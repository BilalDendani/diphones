712-123606-0000 WILLIAM MISSUS TODD HAD TAKEN THE ONION OUT OF HER BASKET AND LAID IT DOWN UPON THE KITCHEN TABLE THERE'S JOHNNY BOWDEN COME WITH US YOU KNOW SHE REMINDED HER MOTHER HE'LL BE HUNGRY ENOUGH TO EAT HIS SIZE
712-123606-0001 I'VE GOT NEW DOUGHNUTS DEAR SAID THE LITTLE OLD LADY
712-123606-0002 I EXPECT YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSE A SOMEWHAT LARGER FISH BUT I'LL TRY AN MAKE IT DO I SHALL HAVE TO HAVE A FEW EXTRA POTATOES BUT THERE'S A FIELD FULL OUT THERE AN THE HOE'S LEANIN AGAINST THE WELL HOUSE
712-123606-0003 IN MONGST THE CLIMBIN' BEANS SHE SMILED
712-123606-0004 LAND SAKES ALIVE
712-123606-0005 INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH SOME EXCITEMENT
712-123606-0006 HE'LL KNOW YOU NEED HIM FOR SOMETHING PARTICULAR AN THEN WE CAN CALL TO HIM AS HE COMES UP THE PATH I WON'T PUT HIM TO NO PAIN MISSUS BLACKETT'S OLD FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME
712-123606-0007 WORE A LOOK OF TROUBLE AND I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE TEASING SPIRIT OF ALMIRA IT WAS TOO PLEASANT TO STAY INDOORS ALTOGETHER EVEN IN SUCH REWARDING COMPANIONSHIP BESIDES I MIGHT MEET WILLIAM
712-123606-0008 AND STRAYING OUT PRESENTLY I FOUND THE HOE BY THE WELL HOUSE AND AN OLD SPLINT BASKET AT THE WOODSHED DOOR AND ALSO FOUND MY WAY DOWN TO THE FIELD WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT SQUARE PATCH OF ROUGH WEEDY POTATO TOPS AND TALL RAGWEED
712-123606-0009 ONE CORNER WAS ALREADY DUG AND I CHOSE A FAT LOOKING HILL WHERE THE TOPS WERE WELL WITHERED THERE IS ALL THE PLEASURE THAT ONE CAN HAVE IN GOLD DIGGING IN FINDING ONE'S HOPES SATISFIED IN THE RICHES OF A GOOD HILL OF POTATOES
712-123606-0010 I LONGED TO GO ON BUT IT DID NOT SEEM FRUGAL TO DIG ANY LONGER AFTER MY BASKET WAS FULL AND AT LAST I TOOK MY HOE BY THE MIDDLE AND LIFTED THE BASKET TO GO BACK UP THE HILL
712-123606-0011 I WAS SURE THAT MISSUS BLACKETT MUST BE WAITING IMPATIENTLY TO SLICE THE POTATOES INTO THE CHOWDER LAYER AFTER LAYER WITH THE FISH YOU LET ME TAKE HOLT O THAT BASKET MA'AM SAID THE PLEASANT ANXIOUS VOICE BEHIND ME I TURNED
712-123606-0012 STARTLED IN THE SILENCE OF THE WIDE FIELD AND SAW AN ELDERLY MAN BENT IN THE SHOULDERS AS FISHERMEN OFTEN ARE GRAY HEADED AND CLEAN SHAVEN AND WITH A TIMID AIR IT WAS WILLIAM HE LOOKED JUST LIKE HIS MOTHER AND I HAD BEEN IMAGINING
712-123606-0013 THAT HE WAS LARGE AND STOUT LIKE HIS SISTER ALMIRA TODD AND STRANGE TO SAY MY FANCY HAD LED ME TO PICTURE HIM NOT FAR FROM THIRTY AND A LITTLE LOUTISH IT WAS NECESSARY INSTEAD TO PAY WILLIAM THE RESPECT DUE TO AGE
712-123606-0014 I ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO PLAIN FACTS ON THE INSTANT AND WE SAID GOOD MORNING LIKE OLD FRIENDS THE BASKET WAS REALLY HEAVY AND I PUT THE HOE THROUGH ITS HANDLE AND OFFERED HIM ONE END
712-123606-0015 THEN WE MOVED EASILY TOWARD THE HOUSE TOGETHER SPEAKING OF THE FINE WEATHER AND OF MACKEREL WHICH WERE REPORTED TO BE STRIKING IN ALL ABOUT THE BAY WILLIAM HAD BEEN OUT SINCE THREE O'CLOCK AND HAD TAKEN AN EXTRA FARE OF FISH
712-123606-0016 I COULD FEEL THAT MISSUS TODD'S EYES WERE UPON US AS WE APPROACHED THE HOUSE AND ALTHOUGH I FELL BEHIND IN THE NARROW PATH AND LET WILLIAM TAKE THE BASKET ALONE AND PRECEDE ME AT SOME LITTLE DISTANCE THE REST OF THE WAY
712-123606-0017 I COULD PLAINLY HEAR HER GREET HIM GOT ROUND TO COMIN IN DIDN'T YOU SHE INQUIRED WITH AMUSEMENT WELL NOW THAT'S CLEVER DIDN'T KNOW'S I SHOULD SEE YOU TO DAY WILLIAM AN I WANTED TO SETTLE AN ACCOUNT
712-123606-0018 I FELT SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AND RESPONSIBLE BUT WHEN I JOINED THEM THEY WERE ON MOST SIMPLE AND FRIENDLY TERMS IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT WITH WILLIAM IT WAS THE FIRST STEP THAT COST AND THAT HAVING ONCE JOINED IN SOCIAL INTERESTS
712-123606-0019 HE WAS ABLE TO PURSUE THEM WITH MORE OR LESS PLEASURE HE WAS ABOUT SIXTY AND NOT YOUNG LOOKING FOR HIS YEARS
712-123606-0020 HAS SUCH A POWER OF SURVIVAL THAT I FELT ALL THE TIME AS IF ONE MUST TRY TO MAKE THE OCCASION EASY FOR SOME ONE WHO WAS YOUNG AND NEW TO THE AFFAIRS OF SOCIAL LIFE HE ASKED POLITELY IF I WOULD LIKE TO GO UP TO THE GREAT LEDGE
712-123606-0021 WHILE DINNER WAS GETTING READY SO NOT WITHOUT A DEEP SENSE OF PLEASURE AND A DELIGHTED LOOK OF SURPRISE FROM THE TWO HOSTESSES WE STARTED WILLIAM AND I AS IF BOTH OF US FELT MUCH YOUNGER THAN WE LOOKED
712-123606-0022 SUCH WAS THE INNOCENCE AND SIMPLICITY OF THE MOMENT THAT WHEN I HEARD MISSUS TODD LAUGHING BEHIND US IN THE KITCHEN I LAUGHED TOO BUT WILLIAM DID NOT EVEN BLUSH I THINK HE WAS A LITTLE DEAF AND HE STEPPED ALONG
712-123606-0023 BEFORE ME MOST BUSINESSLIKE AND INTENT UPON HIS ERRAND WE WENT FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE FIELD ABOVE THE HOUSE INTO A SMOOTH BROWN PATH AMONG THE DARK SPRUCES THE HOT SUN BROUGHT OUT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE PITCHY BARK
712-123606-0024 AND THE SHADE WAS PLEASANT AS WE CLIMBED THE HILL WILLIAM STOPPED ONCE OR TWICE TO SHOW ME A GREAT WASPS' NEST CLOSE BY OR SOME FISHHAWKS' NESTS BELOW IN A BIT OF SWAMP
712-123606-0025 HE PICKED A FEW SPRIGS OF LATE BLOOMING LINNAEA AS WE CAME OUT UPON AN OPEN BIT OF PASTURE AT THE TOP OF THE ISLAND AND GAVE THEM TO ME WITHOUT SPEAKING BUT HE KNEW AS WELL AS I THAT ONE COULD NOT SAY HALF HE WISHED ABOUT LINNAEA
712-123606-0026 THROUGH THIS PIECE OF ROUGH PASTURE RAN A HUGE SHAPE OF STONE LIKE THE GREAT BACKBONE OF AN ENORMOUS CREATURE AT THE END NEAR THE WOODS WE COULD CLIMB UP ON IT AND WALK ALONG TO THE HIGHEST POINT
