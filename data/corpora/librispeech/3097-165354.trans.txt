3097-165354-0000 IN A NEW COUNTRY AMID NEW CONDITIONS PRINCE ANDREW FOUND LIFE EASIER TO BEAR AFTER HIS BETROTHED HAD BROKEN FAITH WITH HIM WHICH HE FELT THE MORE ACUTELY THE MORE HE TRIED TO CONCEAL ITS EFFECTS THE SURROUNDINGS IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN HAPPY BECAME TRYING TO HIM
3097-165354-0001 AND THE FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE HE HAD ONCE PRIZED SO HIGHLY WERE STILL MORE SO
3097-165354-0002 HAD SUDDENLY TURNED INTO A LOW SOLID VAULT THAT WEIGHED HIM DOWN IN WHICH ALL WAS CLEAR BUT NOTHING ETERNAL OR MYSTERIOUS OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HIM
3097-165354-0003 ARMY SERVICE WAS THE SIMPLEST AND MOST FAMILIAR AS A GENERAL ON DUTY ON KUTUZOV'S STAFF HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO BUSINESS WITH ZEAL AND PERSEVERANCE AND SURPRISED KUTUZOV
3097-165354-0004 BY HIS WILLINGNESS AND ACCURACY IN WORK NOT HAVING FOUND KURAGIN IN TURKEY PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO RUSH BACK TO RUSSIA AFTER HIM
3097-165354-0005 DESPITE HIS CONTEMPT FOR HIM AND DESPITE ALL THE PROOFS HE DEDUCED TO CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH STOOPING TO A CONFLICT WITH HIM HE KNEW THAT WHEN HE DID MEET HIM HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST CALLING HIM OUT ANY MORE THAN A RAVENOUS MAN CAN HELP SNATCHING AT FOOD
3097-165354-0006 AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE INSULT WAS NOT YET AVENGED THAT HIS RANCOR WAS STILL UNSPENT WEIGHED ON HIS HEART AND POISONED THE ARTIFICIAL TRANQUILLITY WHICH HE MANAGED TO OBTAIN IN TURKEY BY MEANS OF RESTLESS PLODDING
3097-165354-0007 AND RATHER VAINGLORIOUS AND AMBITIOUS ACTIVITY
3097-165354-0008 PRINCE ANDREW ASKED KUTUZOV TO TRANSFER HIM TO THE WESTERN ARMY KUTUZOV WHO WAS ALREADY WEARY OF BOLKONSKI'S ACTIVITY
3097-165354-0009 ENCAMPED AT DRISSA PRINCE ANDREW VISITED BALD HILLS WHICH WAS DIRECTLY ON HIS WAY BEING ONLY TWO MILES OFF THE SMOLENSK HIGHROAD DURING THE LAST THREE YEARS THERE HAD BEEN SO MANY CHANGES IN HIS LIFE HE HAD THOUGHT FELT
3097-165354-0010 AND SEEN SO MUCH HAVING TRAVELED BOTH IN THE EAST AND THE WEST THAT ON REACHING BALD HILLS IT STRUCK HIM AS STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED TO FIND THE WAY OF LIFE THERE UNCHANGED AND STILL THE SAME IN EVERY DETAIL
3097-165354-0011 HE ENTERED THROUGH THE GATES WITH THEIR STONE PILLARS AND DROVE UP THE AVENUE LEADING TO THE HOUSE AS IF HE WERE ENTERING AN ENCHANTED SLEEPING CASTLE THE SAME OLD STATELINESS THE SAME CLEANLINESS THE SAME STILLNESS REIGNED THERE
3097-165354-0012 AND INSIDE THERE WAS THE SAME FURNITURE THE SAME WALLS SOUNDS AND SMELL AND THE SAME TIMID FACES ONLY SOMEWHAT OLDER PRINCESS MARY WAS STILL THE SAME TIMID PLAIN MAIDEN GETTING ON IN YEARS
3097-165354-0013 USELESSLY AND JOYLESSLY PASSING THE BEST YEARS OF HER LIFE IN FEAR AND CONSTANT SUFFERING MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE WAS THE SAME COQUETTISH SELF SATISFIED GIRL ENJOYING EVERY MOMENT OF HER EXISTENCE AND FULL OF JOYOUS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE
3097-165354-0014 SHE HAD MERELY BECOME MORE SELF CONFIDENT PRINCE ANDREW THOUGHT DESSALLES THE TUTOR HE HAD BROUGHT FROM SWITZERLAND WAS WEARING A COAT OF RUSSIAN CUT AND TALKING BROKEN RUSSIAN TO THE SERVANTS
3097-165354-0015 AND PEDANTIC PRECEPTOR THE OLD PRINCE HAD CHANGED IN APPEARANCE ONLY BY THE LOSS OF A TOOTH WHICH LEFT A NOTICEABLE GAP ON ONE SIDE OF HIS MOUTH IN CHARACTER HE WAS THE SAME AS EVER ONLY SHOWING STILL MORE IRRITABILITY
3097-165354-0016 AND SKEPTICISM AS TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD LITTLE NICHOLAS ALONE HAD CHANGED HE HAD GROWN BECOME ROSIER HAD CURLY DARK HAIR AND WHEN MERRY AND LAUGHING
3097-165354-0017 BUT THOUGH EXTERNALLY ALL REMAINED AS OF OLD THE INNER RELATIONS OF ALL THESE PEOPLE HAD CHANGED SINCE PRINCE ANDREW HAD SEEN THEM LAST THE HOUSEHOLD WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO ALIEN AND HOSTILE CAMPS WHO CHANGED THEIR HABITS
3097-165354-0018 FOR HIS SAKE AND ONLY MET BECAUSE HE WAS THERE TO THE ONE CAMP BELONGED THE OLD PRINCE MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE AND THE ARCHITECT TO THE OTHER PRINCESS MARY DESSALLES LITTLE NICHOLAS AND ALL THE OLD NURSES AND MAIDS DURING HIS STAY AT BALD HILLS ALL THE FAMILY DINED TOGETHER
3097-165354-0019 AND PRINCE ANDREW FELT THAT HE WAS A VISITOR FOR WHOSE SAKE AN EXCEPTION WAS BEING MADE AND THAT HIS PRESENCE MADE THEM ALL FEEL AWKWARD INVOLUNTARILY FEELING THIS AT DINNER ON THE FIRST DAY HE WAS TACITURN AND THE OLD PRINCE NOTICING THIS ALSO BECAME MOROSELY DUMB
3097-165354-0020 AND RETIRED TO HIS APARTMENTS DIRECTLY AFTER DINNER IN THE EVENING WHEN PRINCE ANDREW WENT TO HIM AND TRYING TO ROUSE HIM
3097-165354-0021 BLAMING HER FOR HER SUPERSTITIONS AND HER DISLIKE OF MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE WHO HE SAID WAS THE ONLY PERSON REALLY ATTACHED TO HIM THE OLD PRINCE SAID THAT IF HE WAS ILL IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF PRINCESS MARY
3097-165354-0022 THAT SHE PURPOSELY WORRIED AND IRRITATED HIM AND THAT BY INDULGENCE AND SILLY TALK SHE WAS SPOILING LITTLE PRINCE NICHOLAS THE OLD PRINCE KNEW VERY WELL THAT HE TORMENTED HIS DAUGHTER AND THAT HER LIFE WAS VERY HARD
3097-165354-0023 BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT HELP TORMENTING HER AND THAT SHE DESERVED IT WHY DOES PRINCE ANDREW WHO SEES THIS SAY NOTHING TO ME ABOUT HIS SISTER DOES HE THINK ME A SCOUNDREL OR AN OLD FOOL WHO WITHOUT ANY REASON KEEPS HIS OWN DAUGHTER AT A DISTANCE AND ATTACHES THIS FRENCHWOMAN TO HIMSELF
3097-165354-0024 HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND SO I MUST EXPLAIN IT AND HE MUST HEAR ME OUT THOUGHT THE OLD PRINCE AND HE BEGAN EXPLAINING WHY HE COULD NOT PUT UP WITH HIS DAUGHTER'S UNREASONABLE CHARACTER IF YOU ASK ME
3097-165354-0025 SAID PRINCE ANDREW WITHOUT LOOKING UP HE WAS CENSURING HIS FATHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE I DID NOT WISH TO SPEAK ABOUT IT BUT AS YOU ASK ME I WILL GIVE YOU MY FRANK OPINION IF THERE IS ANY MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISCORD BETWEEN YOU AND MARY I CAN'T BLAME HER FOR IT AT ALL
3097-165354-0026 I KNOW HOW SHE LOVES AND RESPECTS YOU SINCE YOU ASK ME CONTINUED PRINCE ANDREW BECOMING IRRITABLE AS HE WAS ALWAYS LIABLE TO DO OF LATE I CAN ONLY SAY THAT IF THERE ARE ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS THEY ARE CAUSED BY THAT WORTHLESS WOMAN WHO IS NOT FIT TO BE MY SISTER'S COMPANION
3097-165354-0027 AND AN UNNATURAL SMILE DISCLOSED THE FRESH GAP BETWEEN HIS TEETH TO WHICH PRINCE ANDREW COULD NOT GET ACCUSTOMED WHAT COMPANION MY DEAR BOY EH YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN TALKING IT OVER EH
3097-165354-0028 FATHER I DID NOT WANT TO JUDGE SAID PRINCE ANDREW IN A HARD AND BITTER TONE BUT YOU CHALLENGED ME AND I HAVE SAID AND ALWAYS SHALL SAY THAT MARY IS NOT TO BLAME BUT THOSE TO BLAME THE ONE TO BLAME IS THAT FRENCHWOMAN AH HE HAS PASSED JUDGMENT
3097-165354-0029 PASSED JUDGEMENT SAID THE OLD MAN IN A LOW VOICE AND AS IT SEEMED TO PRINCE ANDREW WITH SOME EMBARRASSMENT BUT THEN HE SUDDENLY JUMPED UP AND CRIED BE OFF BE OFF LET NOT A TRACE OF YOU REMAIN HERE
3097-165354-0030 PRINCE ANDREW WISHED TO LEAVE AT ONCE BUT PRINCESS MARY PERSUADED HIM TO STAY ANOTHER DAY THAT DAY HE DID NOT SEE HIS FATHER WHO DID NOT LEAVE HIS ROOM AND ADMITTED NO ONE BUT MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE AND TIKHON
3097-165354-0031 BUT ASKED SEVERAL TIMES WHETHER HIS SON HAD GONE NEXT DAY BEFORE LEAVING PRINCE ANDREW WENT TO HIS SON'S ROOMS THE BOY CURLY HEADED LIKE HIS MOTHER AND GLOWING WITH HEALTH SAT ON HIS KNEE AND PRINCE ANDREW BEGAN TELLING HIM THE STORY OF BLUEBEARD
3097-165354-0032 BUT FELL INTO A REVERIE WITHOUT FINISHING THE STORY HE THOUGHT NOT OF THIS PRETTY CHILD HIS SON WHOM HE HELD ON HIS KNEE BUT OF HIMSELF HE SOUGHT IN HIMSELF EITHER REMORSE FOR HAVING ANGERED HIS FATHER OR REGRET AT LEAVING HOME
3097-165354-0033 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE ON BAD TERMS WITH HIM AND WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND NEITHER WHAT MEANT STILL MORE TO HIM WAS THAT HE SOUGHT AND DID NOT FIND IN HIMSELF THE FORMER TENDERNESS FOR HIS SON WHICH HE HAD HOPED TO REAWAKEN BY CARESSING THE BOY
3097-165354-0034 AND TAKING HIM ON HIS KNEE WELL GO ON SAID HIS SON PRINCE ANDREW WITHOUT REPLYING PUT HIM DOWN FROM HIS KNEE AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AS SOON AS PRINCE ANDREW HAD GIVEN UP HIS DAILY OCCUPATIONS AND ESPECIALLY ON RETURNING TO THE OLD CONDITIONS OF LIFE AMID WHICH HE HAD BEEN HAPPY
3097-165354-0035 WEARINESS OF LIFE OVERCAME HIM WITH ITS FORMER INTENSITY AND HE HASTENED TO ESCAPE FROM THESE MEMORIES AND TO FIND SOME WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO YOU'VE DECIDED TO GO ANDREW ASKED HIS SISTER
3097-165354-0036 THANK GOD THAT I CAN REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW I AM VERY SORRY YOU CAN'T WHY DO YOU SAY THAT REPLIED PRINCESS MARY WHY DO YOU SAY THAT WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO THIS TERRIBLE WAR
3097-165354-0037 MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE SAYS HE HAS BEEN ASKING ABOUT YOU
3097-165354-0038 HER LIPS TREMBLED AND HER TEARS BEGAN TO FALL PRINCE ANDREW TURNED AWAY AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM AH MY GOD MY GOD WHEN ONE THINKS WHO AND WHAT WHAT TRASH CAN CAUSE PEOPLE MISERY HE SAID WITH A MALIGNITY THAT ALARMED PRINCESS MARY
3097-165354-0039 ANDREW ONE THING I BEG I ENTREAT OF YOU SHE SAID TOUCHING HIS ELBOW AND LOOKING AT HIM WITH EYES THAT SHONE THROUGH HER TEARS I UNDERSTAND YOU SHE LOOKED DOWN DON'T IMAGINE THAT SORROW IS THE WORK OF MEN
3097-165354-0040 MEN ARE HIS TOOLS SHE LOOKED A LITTLE ABOVE PRINCE ANDREW'S HEAD WITH THE CONFIDENT ACCUSTOMED LOOK WITH WHICH ONE LOOKS AT THE PLACE WHERE A FAMILIAR PORTRAIT HANGS
3097-165354-0041 SORROW IS SENT BY HIM NOT BY MEN MEN ARE HIS INSTRUMENTS THEY ARE NOT TO BLAME IF YOU THINK SOMEONE HAS WRONGED YOU FORGET IT AND FORGIVE WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO PUNISH AND THEN YOU WILL KNOW THE HAPPINESS OF FORGIVING IF I WERE A WOMAN I WOULD DO SO MARY
3097-165354-0042 AND THOUGH TILL THAT MOMENT HE HAD NOT BEEN THINKING OF KURAGIN ALL HIS UNEXPENDED ANGER SUDDENLY SWELLED UP IN HIS HEART IF MARY IS ALREADY PERSUADING ME TO
3097-165354-0043 WHO HE KNEW WAS NOW IN THE ARMY PRINCESS MARY BEGGED HIM TO STAY ONE DAY MORE
3097-165354-0044 SOON BE BACK AGAIN FROM THE ARMY AND WOULD CERTAINLY WRITE TO HIS FATHER BUT THAT THE LONGER HE STAYED NOW THE MORE EMBITTERED THEIR DIFFERENCES WOULD BECOME GOOD BYE ANDREW REMEMBER THAT MISFORTUNES COME FROM GOD AND MEN ARE NEVER TO BLAME
3097-165354-0045 WERE THE LAST WORDS HE HEARD FROM HIS SISTER WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE OF HER THEN IT MUST BE SO THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW AS HE DROVE OUT OF THE AVENUE FROM THE HOUSE AT BALD HILLS
3097-165354-0046 SHE POOR INNOCENT CREATURE IS LEFT TO BE VICTIMIZED BY AN OLD MAN WHO HAS OUTLIVED HIS WITS THE OLD MAN FEELS HE IS GUILTY BUT CANNOT CHANGE HIMSELF MY BOY IS GROWING UP AND REJOICES IN LIFE IN WHICH LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE HE WILL DECEIVE OR BE DECEIVED AND I AM OFF TO THE ARMY WHY
3097-165354-0047 I MYSELF DON'T KNOW I WANT TO MEET THAT MAN WHOM I DESPISE SO AS TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO KILL AND LAUGH AT ME THESE CONDITIONS OF LIFE HAD BEEN THE SAME BEFORE BUT THEN THEY WERE ALL CONNECTED WHILE NOW THEY HAD ALL TUMBLED TO PIECES ONLY SENSELESS THINGS
