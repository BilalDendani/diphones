6076-51655-0000 CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVENTH THERE WAS A CERTAIN MARRIED LADY AT EPHESUS ONCE UPON A TIME SO NOTED FOR HER CHASTITY THAT SHE EVEN DREW WOMEN FROM THE NEIGHBORING STATES TO COME TO GAZE UPON HER WHEN SHE CARRIED OUT HER HUSBAND SHE WAS BY NO MEANS CONTENT TO COMPLY WITH THE CONVENTIONAL CUSTOM
6076-51655-0001 BEATING HER NAKED BREAST IN SIGHT OF THE ONLOOKERS SHE FOLLOWED THE CORPSE EVEN INTO THE TOMB AND WHEN THE BODY HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE VAULT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GREEK CUSTOM SHE BEGAN TO STAND VIGIL OVER IT WEEPING DAY AND NIGHT
6076-51655-0002 NEITHER PARENTS NOR RELATIONS COULD DIVERT HER FROM PUNISHING HERSELF IN THIS MANNER AND FROM BRINGING ON DEATH BY STARVATION THE MAGISTRATES THE LAST RESORT WERE REBUFFED AND WENT AWAY
6076-51655-0003 AND THE LADY MOURNED BY ALL AS AN UNUSUAL EXAMPLE DRAGGED THROUGH THE FIFTH DAY WITHOUT NOURISHMENT A MOST FAITHFUL MAID WAS IN ATTENDANCE UPON THE POOR WOMAN SHE EITHER WEPT IN COMPANY WITH THE AFFLICTED ONE OR REPLENISHED THE LAMP WHICH WAS PLACED IN THE VAULT AS THE OCCASION REQUIRED
6076-51655-0004 THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CITY THERE WAS BUT ONE OPINION MEN OF EVERY CALLING AGREED THAT HERE SHONE THE ONE SOLITARY EXAMPLE OF CHASTITY AND OF LOVE IN THE MEANTIME THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE HAD ORDERED SOME ROBBERS CRUCIFIED NEAR THE LITTLE VAULT IN WHICH THE LADY WAS BEWAILING HER RECENT LOSS
6076-51655-0005 SO HE DESCENDED INTO THE TOMB AND CATCHING SIGHT OF A MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN HE STOOD STILL AFRAID AT FIRST THAT IT WAS SOME APPARITION OR SPIRIT FROM THE INFERNAL REGIONS BUT HE FINALLY COMPREHENDED THE TRUE STATE OF AFFAIRS AS HIS EYE TOOK IN THE CORPSE LYING THERE
6076-51655-0006 HE THEN BROUGHT HIS OWN SCANTY RATION INTO THE VAULT AND EXHORTED THE SOBBING MOURNER NOT TO PERSEVERE IN USELESS GRIEF
6076-51655-0007 THE SAME END AWAITED US ALL THE SAME LAST RESTING PLACE AND OTHER PLATITUDES BY WHICH ANGUISHED MINDS ARE RECALLED TO SANITY BUT OBLIVIOUS TO SYMPATHY SHE BEAT AND LACERATED HER BOSOM MORE VEHEMENTLY THAN BEFORE AND TEARING OUT HER HAIR
6076-51655-0008 SHE STREWED IT UPON THE BREAST OF THE CORPSE NOTWITHSTANDING THIS THE SOLDIER WOULD NOT LEAVE OFF
6076-51655-0009 UNTIL THE MAID SEDUCED BY THE SMELL OF THE WINE I SUPPOSE
6076-51655-0010 WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO YOU TO DIE OF HUNGER SHE ASKED OR TO BURY YOURSELF ALIVE OR TO SURRENDER AN UNCONDEMNED SPIRIT BEFORE THE FATES DEMAND IT
6076-51655-0011 WOULD YOU RECALL THE DEAD FROM THE RELUCTANT FATES WHY NOT SHAKE OFF THIS WOMANISH WEAKNESS AND ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF LIGHT WHILE YOU CAN
6076-51655-0012 WHEN PRESSED TO EAT OR TO LIVE NO ONE LISTENS UNWILLINGLY AND THE LADY THIRSTY AFTER AN ABSTINENCE OF SEVERAL DAYS FINALLY PERMITTED HER OBSTINACY TO BE OVERCOME NOR DID SHE TAKE HER FILL OF NOURISHMENT WITH LESS AVIDITY THAN HAD THE MAID WHO HAD SURRENDERED FIRST
6076-51655-0013 DID THE YOUNG MAN SEEM UNCOUTH OR WANTING IN ADDRESS THE MAID PLED IN HIS BEHALF AND KEPT REPEATING WHY WILL YOU FIGHT WITH A PASSION THAT TO YOU IS PLEASURE REMEMBERING NOT IN WHOSE LANDS YOU ARE TAKING YOUR LEISURE
6076-51655-0014 BUT WHY SHOULD I KEEP YOU LONGER IN SUSPENSE THE LADY OBSERVED THE SAME ABSTINENCE WHEN IT CAME TO THIS PART OF HER BODY AND THE VICTORIOUS SOLDIER WON BOTH OF HIS OBJECTIVES SO THEY LAY TOGETHER NOT ONLY THAT NIGHT
6076-51655-0015 SHUTTING THE DOORS OF THE VAULT OF COURSE SO THAT ANYONE ACQUAINTANCE OR STRANGER COMING TO THE TOMB WOULD BE CONVINCED THAT THIS MOST VIRTUOUS OF WIVES HAD EXPIRED UPON THE BODY OF HER HUSBAND AS FOR THE SOLDIER SO DELIGHTED WAS HE WITH THE BEAUTY OF HIS MISTRESS AND THE SECRECY OF THE INTRIGUE
6076-51655-0016 THAT HE PURCHASED ALL THE DELICACIES HIS PAY PERMITTED AND SMUGGLED THEM INTO THE VAULT AS SOON AS DARKNESS FELL MEANWHILE THE PARENTS OF ONE OF THE CRUCIFIED CRIMINALS OBSERVING THE LAXNESS OF THE WATCH DRAGGED THE HANGING CORPSE DOWN AT NIGHT AND PERFORMED THE LAST RITE
6076-51655-0017 THE SOLDIER WAS HOODWINKED WHILE ABSENT FROM HIS POST OF DUTY AND WHEN ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ONE OF THE CROSSES WITHOUT ITS CORPSE HE WAS IN TERROR OF PUNISHMENT AND EXPLAINED TO THE LADY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HE WOULD AWAIT NO SENTENCE OF COURT MARTIAL
6076-51655-0018 BUT WOULD PUNISH HIS NEGLECT OF DUTY WITH HIS OWN SWORD LET HER PREPARE A PLACE FOR ONE ABOUT TO DIE LET THAT FATAL VAULT SERVE BOTH THE LOVER AND THE HUSBAND NOT THAT
6076-51655-0019 I WOULD RATHER HANG THE DEAD THAN SLAY THE LIVING SO SAYING SHE GAVE ORDERS FOR THE BODY OF HER HUSBAND TO BE LIFTED OUT OF THE COFFIN AND FASTENED UPON THE VACANT CROSS
6076-51655-0020 BUT LYCAS DID NOT LAUGH IF THAT GOVERNOR HAD BEEN A JUST MAN SAID HE SHAKING HIS HEAD ANGRILY HE WOULD HAVE ORDERED THE HUSBAND'S BODY TAKEN DOWN AND CARRIED BACK INTO THE VAULT AND CRUCIFIED THE WOMAN NO DOUBT THE MEMORY OF HEDYLE HAUNTED HIS MIND AND THE LOOTING OF HIS SHIP IN THAT WANTON EXCURSION
6076-51655-0021 UNEASY AND CHAGRINED AT THIS NEW LEAGUE
6076-51655-0022 EVERY KISS WAS A WOUND TO ME EVERY ARTFUL BLANDISHMENT WHICH THE WANTON WOMAN EMPLOYED AND I COULD NOT MAKE UP MY MIND AS TO WHETHER I WAS MORE ANGERED AT THE BOY FOR HAVING SUPPLANTED ME WITH MY MISTRESS OR AT MY MISTRESS FOR DEBAUCHING THE BOY BOTH WERE HATEFUL TO MY SIGHT AND MORE GALLING THAN MY LATE SERVITUDE
6076-51655-0023 NOR EVEN SPEAK TO ME IN THE COURSE OF THE COMMON CONVERSATION I SUPPOSE HE WAS AFRAID OF REOPENING A TENDER SCAR AT THE MOMENT WHEN A RETURN TO HER GOOD GRACES HAD COMMENCED TO DRAW IT TOGETHER TEARS OF VEXATION DROPPED UPON MY BREAST AND THE GROAN I SMOTHERED IN A SIGH NEARLY WRACKED MY SOUL
6076-51655-0024 THE VULTURE TEARING AT THE LIVER'S DEEP AND VITAL PARTS THAT WRACKS OUR BREASTS AND RENDS OUR VERY HEARTSTRINGS IS NOT THAT BIRD THE CHARMING POET SINGS WITH ALL HIS ARTS T'IS JEALOUSY OR HATE THAT HUMAN HEARTS STINGS
6076-51655-0025 IN SPITE OF MY ILL HUMOR LYCAS SAW HOW WELL MY GOLDEN CURLS BECAME ME AND BECOMING ENAMOURED ANEW BEGAN WINKING HIS WANTON EYES AT ME AND SOUGHT ADMISSION TO MY GOOD GRACES UPON A FOOTING OF PLEASURE
6076-51655-0026 NOR DID HE PUT ON THE ARROGANCE OF A MASTER BUT SPOKE AS A FRIEND ASKING A FAVOR LONG AND ARDENTLY HE TRIED TO GAIN HIS ENDS BUT ALL IN VAIN TILL AT LAST MEETING WITH A DECISIVE REPULSE HIS PASSION TURNED TO FURY AND HE TRIED TO CARRY THE PLACE BY STORM
6076-51655-0027 SHE SPRANG AT US AND TORE US APART THOROUGHLY ENRAGED AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF HER LECHEROUS PASSION
6076-51655-0028 I PRESSED HER EARNESTLY TO TELL ME THE REASON FOR HER SOBS AND AFTER PRETENDING TO BE RELUCTANT SHE BROKE OUT YOU WILL THINK NO MORE OF HER THAN OF A COMMON PROSTITUTE IF YOU HAVE A DROP OF DECENT BLOOD IN YOUR VEINS YOU WILL NOT RESORT TO THAT FEMALE CATAMITE IF YOU ARE A MAN
6076-51655-0029 THIS DISTURBED MY MIND BUT
6076-51655-0030 BEING A VERY SARCASTIC INDIVIDUAL MIGHT REVENGE MY SUPPOSED INJURY IN SOME POETIC LAMPOON IN WHICH EVENT HIS ARDENT ZEAL WOULD WITHOUT DOUBT EXPOSE ME TO RIDICULE AND I GREATLY DREADED THAT BUT WHILE I WAS DEBATING WITH MYSELF AS TO THE BEST MEANS OF PREVENTING HIM FROM GETTING AT THE FACTS
6076-51655-0031 AND HAD TRIED TO INDEMNIFY HERSELF FOR MY REPULSE AT THE EXPENSE OF MY LITTLE FRIEND
6076-51655-0032 WHEN HE HAD HEARD ALL THE FACTS EUMOLPUS SWORE ROUNDLY THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY AVENGE US AS THE GODS WERE JUST AND WOULD NOT SUFFER SO MANY VILLAINIES TO GO UNPUNISHED CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEENTH
6076-51655-0033 BUT THE GALE DID NOT DRIVE THE WAVES IN ANY ONE DIRECTION AND THE HELMSMAN LOST HIS BEARINGS AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT COURSE TO STEER AT ONE MOMENT THE WIND WOULD SET TOWARDS SICILY BUT THE NEXT THE NORTH WIND PREVAILING ON THE ITALIAN COAST
6076-51655-0034 WOULD DRIVE THE UNLUCKY VESSEL HITHER AND YON AND WHAT WAS MORE DANGEROUS THAN ALL THE RAIN SQUALLS A PALL OF SUCH BLACK DENSITY BLOTTED OUT THE LIGHT THAT THE HELMSMAN COULD NOT EVEN SEE AS FAR FORWARD AS THE BOW
6076-51655-0035 AT LAST AS THE SAVAGE FURY OF THE SEA GREW MORE MALIGNANT THE TREMBLING LYCAS STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS TO ME IMPLORINGLY SAVE US FROM DESTRUCTION ENCOLPIUS HE SHOUTED RESTORE THAT SACRED ROBE AND HOLY RATTLE TO THE SHIP
6076-51655-0036 BE MERCIFUL FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE JUST AS YOU USED TO BE HE WAS STILL SHOUTING WHEN A WINDSQUALL SWEPT HIM INTO THE SEA THE RAGING ELEMENTS WHIRLED HIM AROUND AND AROUND IN A TERRIBLE MAELSTROM AND SUCKED HIM DOWN
6076-51655-0037 EMBRACING GITON I WEPT ALOUD DID WE DESERVE THIS FROM THE GODS I CRIED TO BE UNITED ONLY IN DEATH NO MALIGNANT FORTUNE GRUDGES EVEN THAT LOOK IN AN INSTANT THE WAVES WILL CAPSIZE THE SHIP THINK IN AN INSTANT THE SEA WILL SEVER THIS LOVER'S EMBRACE
6076-51655-0038 IF YOU EVER LOVED ENCOLPIUS TRULY KISS HIM WHILE YET YOU MAY AND SNATCH THIS LAST DELIGHT FROM IMPENDING DISSOLUTION
6076-51655-0039 GITON REMOVED HIS GARMENT AND CREEPING BENEATH MY TUNIC HE STUCK OUT HIS HEAD TO BE KISSED THEN FEARING SOME MORE SPITEFUL WAVE MIGHT SEPARATE US AS WE CLUNG TOGETHER HE PASSED HIS BELT AROUND US BOTH IF NOTHING ELSE HE CRIED
6076-51655-0040 THE SEA WILL AT LEAST BEAR US LONGER JOINED TOGETHER AND IF IN PITY IT CASTS US UP
6076-51655-0041 OR THE LAST RITES WILL BE PERFORMED BY THE DRIFTING SAND IN SPITE OF THE ANGRY WAVES I SUBMIT TO THIS LAST BOND AND AS THOUGH I WERE LAID OUT UPON MY DEATH BED AWAIT AN END NO LONGER DREADED MEANWHILE ACCOMPLISHING THE DECREES OF THE FATES
6076-51655-0042 THE STORM STRIPPED THE SHIP OF ALL THAT WAS LEFT NO MAST NO HELM NOT A ROPE NOR AN OAR REMAINED ON BOARD HER
6076-51655-0043 BUT SEEING MEN ALIVE AND READY TO DEFEND THEIR PROPERTY THEY CHANGED THEIR PREDATORY DESIGNS INTO OFFERS OF HELP CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEENTH JUST THEN AMID THAT CLAMOR OF VOICES WE HEARD A PECULIAR NOISE AND FROM BENEATH THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN THERE
6076-51655-0044 CAME A BELLOWING AS OF SOME WILD BEAST TRYING TO GET OUT WE THEN FOLLOWED UP THE SOUND AND DISCOVERED EUMOLPUS SITTING THERE SCRIBBLING VERSES UPON AN IMMENSE SHEET OF PARCHMENT ASTOUNDED THAT HE COULD FIND TIME TO WRITE POETRY AT DEATH'S VERY DOOR
6076-51655-0045 WE HAULED HIM OUT IN SPITE OF HIS PROTESTS AND ORDERED HIM TO RETURN TO HIS SENSES BUT HE FLEW INTO A RAGE AT BEING INTERRUPTED LEAVE ME ALONE UNTIL I FINISH THIS SENTENCE HE BAWLED THE POEM LABORS TO ITS BIRTH
6076-51655-0046 AND HELP ME DRAG THE BELLOWING BARD ASHORE I LAID HANDS UPON THE LUNATIC WHEN THIS JOB HAD AT LAST BEEN COMPLETED WE CAME WET AND WRETCHED TO A FISHERMAN'S HUT AND REFRESHED OURSELVES SOMEWHAT WITH STORES FROM THE WRECK SPOILED THOUGH THEY WERE
6076-51655-0047 BY SALT WATER AND PASSED A NIGHT THAT WAS ALMOST INTERMINABLE AS WE WERE HOLDING A COUNCIL NEXT DAY TO DETERMINE TO WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY WE HAD BEST PROCEED I SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A HUMAN BODY TURNING AROUND IN A GENTLE EDDY AND FLOATING TOWARDS THE SHORE
6076-51655-0048 STRICKEN WITH MELANCHOLY I STOOD STILL AND BEGAN TO BROOD WITH WET EYES UPON THE TREACHERY OF THE SEA
6076-51655-0049 AWAITS THIS MAN OR A SON WHO LITTLE DREAMS OF STORMS OR WRECKS OR PERHAPS HE LEFT BEHIND A FATHER WHOM HE KISSED GOOD BY AT PARTING SUCH IS THE END OF MORTAL'S PLANS SUCH IS THE OUTCOME OF GREAT AMBITIONS SEE HOW MAN RIDES THE WAVES
6076-51655-0050 UNTIL NOW I HAD BEEN SORROWING FOR A MERE STRANGER BUT A WAVE TURNED THE FACE WHICH HAD UNDERGONE NO CHANGE TOWARDS THE SHORE
6076-51655-0051 YOU WHO BOASTED BUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO OF THE STRENGTH OF YOUR COMMAND NOW YOU HAVE NOT A SINGLE PLANK LEFT OF YOUR GREAT SHIP GO ON MORTALS SET YOUR HEARTS UPON THE FULFILLMENT OF GREAT AMBITIONS GO ON SCHEMERS
6076-51655-0052 AND IN YOUR WILLS CONTROL FOR A THOUSAND YEARS THE DISPOSAL OF THE WEALTH YOU GOT BY FRAUD ONLY YESTERDAY THIS MAN AUDITED THE ACCOUNTS OF HIS FAMILY ESTATE YEA EVEN RECKONED THE DAY HE WOULD ARRIVE IN HIS NATIVE LAND AND SETTLED IT IN HIS MIND
6076-51655-0053 GODS AND GODDESSES HOW FAR HE LIES FROM HIS APPOINTED DESTINATION BUT THE WAVES OF THE SEA ARE NOT ALONE IN THUS KEEPING FAITH WITH MORTAL MEN THE WARRIOR'S WEAPONS FAIL HIM THE CITIZEN IS BURIED BENEATH THE RUINS OF HIS OWN PENATES
6076-51655-0054 ANOTHER FALLS FROM HIS CHARIOT AND DASHES OUT HIS ARDENT SPIRIT THE GLUTTON CHOKES AT DINNER
6076-51655-0055 AFTER THESE REFLECTIONS WE MADE READY TO PAY THE LAST RITES TO THE CORPSE AND LYCAS WAS BURNED UPON A FUNERAL PYRE RAISED BY THE HANDS OF ENEMIES WHILE EUMOLPUS FIXING HIS EYES UPON THE FAR DISTANCE TO GAIN INSPIRATION COMPOSED AN EPITAPH FOR THE DEAD MAN
6076-51655-0056 HIS FATE WAS UNAVOIDABLE NO ROCK HEWN TOMB
