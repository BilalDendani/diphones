7398-98878-0000 WE FIND THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMATIC INDICATIONS IN THE AMERICAN PROVINGS
7398-98878-0001 CONTINUING PAINFUL FOR SEVERAL DAYS
7398-98878-0002 ELEVEN NINETY SIX FURUNCLES WITH STINGING PAINS
7398-98878-0003 TWELVE TWENTY TWO DARK BLUISH RED PAINFUL SWELLINGS WITH GENERAL MALAISE ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN ACUTE PAIN AND ERYSIPELATOUS SWELLING VERY HARD AND PALE IN THE CENTRE
7398-98878-0004 A TABLESPOONFUL OF THIS SOLUTION EVERY THREE HOURS GENERALLY RELIEVES THE PAIN IN A SHORT PERIOD PROMOTES SUPPURATION EFFECTS THE DISCHARGE OF THE DECAYED CELLULAR TISSUE
7398-98878-0005 IF FURUNCLES INCLINE TO BECOME CARBUNCULOUS THE ICHOROUS MATTER IS SPEEDILY CHANGED TO GOOD PUS AND ALL DANGER IS AVERTED IN A CASE OF CARBUNCLE THE GANGRENOUS DISORGANIZATION OF THE SKIN AND CELLULAR TISSUE BECOMES VERY SOON CONFINED TO A SMALL SPOT
7398-98878-0006 THE DEAD PARTS ARE SEPARATED FROM THE LIVING TISSUES THE FEVER IS HUSHED THE DISORGANIZATIONS WHICH IT THREATENS ARE AVERTED A HEALTHY SUPPURATION IS ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT THE GANGRENOUS PART DETACHING AND REMOVING ALL DECAYED MATTER
7398-98878-0007 AND REPLACING THE LOSS OF SUBSTANCE BY NEW GRANULATIONS UNTIL THE SORE BECOMES CICATRIZED IN SUCH A HARDLY PERCEPTIBLE MANNER THAT ANY ONE WHO IS ACQUAINTED WITH THE RAVAGES OF THIS DISEASE AND IS IN THE HABIT OF SEEING DEEP AND DISFIGURING CICATRIZES
7398-98878-0008 EVEN IN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CASES IS DISPOSED TO DENY THE FACT THAT SUCH AN INTENSELY DISORGANIZING PROCESS HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THIS INSTANCE NO OTHER REMEDIAL MEANS ARE REQUIRED MUCH LESS A SURGICAL OPERATION
7398-98878-0009 SHOWING THAT THE PSORIC MIASM PERVADES THE TISSUES IT BEHOOVES US IN ORDER TO SECURE ALL THE BETTER A FAVORABLE RESULT TO GIVE A DOSE OF HIGHLY POTENTIZED SULPHUR AT THE VERY OUTSET OF THE DISEASE
7398-98878-0010 THE FORMER IN ALL CASES WHERE NO SULPHUR HAD BEEN USED
7398-98878-0011 SULPHUR SHOULD LIKEWISE BE GIVEN IN ALL CASES WHERE THE FURUNCLES REAPPEAR AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
7398-98878-0012 CORRECTS AT THE SAME TIME THE PRIMARY DEGENERATION OF THE TISSUES WITHOUT EITHER INTERFERING WITH THE OPERATIONS OF THE OTHER DRUG ON THE CONTRARY BY ASSISTING EACH OTHER
7398-98878-0013 GENUINE PANARITIA ONLY SPRING UP IN PSORIC GROUND AND IN REGARD TO EXTENT AND INTENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT DEPEND ALTOGETHER UPON THE EXISTING PSORIC TAINT
7398-98878-0014 THIS IS MOST EFFECTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED BY AT ONCE GIVING SULPHUR THE MOST POWERFUL OF OUR ANTI PSORICS SULPHUR SEEMS TO ATTACK THE EVIL AT ITS VERY FOUNDATION AND WE FEEL PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH ITS ACTION
7398-98878-0015 IN ORDER TO ABBREVIATE THE TORTURES INHERENT IN THIS MALADY THIS RESULT IS MOST CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF APIS
7398-98878-0016 AS LONG AS THE WORLD CONTINUES TO LIVE IN DARKNESS AND TO REJECT THE RAYS OF TRUTH WHICH THE GENIUS OF HAHNEMANN HAS SENT FORTH AMONG THE BENIGHTED UNDERSTANDINGS OF HIS FELLOW BEINGS
7398-98878-0017 NOTWITHSTANDING HAHNEMANN'S TEACHINGS CONCERNING THE MEDICINAL POWER OF SULPHUR WHICH THE WORLD HAS NOW BEEN IN POSSESSION OF FOR YEARS AND WHICH THE MOST THOUGHTFUL MINDS HAVE ACCEPTED AS A TRUTH
7398-98878-0018 HAEMORRHOIDAL PATIENTS CONTINUE TO SWALLOW SULPHUR FROM DAY TO DAY ALMOST EVERY BODY FROM THE CHILD UP TO THE OLD MAN WHO IS AFFECTED WITH CATARRH SWALLOWS THE SO TERMED PULMONARY POWDERS WHICH CONTAIN SULPHUR AND OF WHICH RELIEF IS EXPECTED
7398-98878-0019 WHOLE LEGIONS REPAIR EVERY YEAR TO THE SULPHUR SPRINGS YOUNG AND OLD USE SULPHUR BATHS AT HOME ALL OVER THE WORLD THE ITCH WHICH IS A VERY COMMON DISEASE IS REMOVED BY MEANS OF A SULPHUR OINTMENT
7398-98878-0020 ONE OF THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IGNORANCE WHICH PARTICULARLY OPPRESSES THE LABORING CLASS IS THE ARTIFICIAL DEVELOPMENT OF PANARITIA THE MORE FREQUENTLY THESE OCCUR THE MORE NECESSARY IT IS TO EMPLOY SPEEDY AND SAFE MEANS FOR THEIR EXTERMINATION
7398-98878-0021 IN SUCH A CASE WE CAN NO LONGER DEPEND UPON SULPHUR OF WHICH WE CANNOT POSSIBLY KNOW HOW FAR IT HAS ALREADY POISONED THE ORGANISM AND TO WHAT EXTENT IT MAY STILL BE ABLE TO ROUSE A REACTION
7398-98878-0022 IT IS EVEN SUFFICIENT TO ARREST THE DISORGANIZING PROCESS AND TO BRING ABOUT A SATISFACTORILY PROGRESSING CURE THE CURATIVE INDICATIONS CONTAINED IN THE AMERICAN PROVINGS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED BY MY OWN EXPERIENCE
7398-98878-0023 THE PHALANGEAL BONES ARE PAINFUL BURNING JERKING LIKE A STITCHING CONTRACTING SENSATION IN THE RIGHT NUMB FROM WITHOUT INWARDS DRAWING PAINS REACHING THE EXTREMITIES OF THE FINGERS DISTINCT FEELING OF NUMBNESS IN THE FINGERS ESPECIALLY IN THE TIPS
7398-98878-0024 AROUND THE ROOTS OF THE NAILS WITH SENSATION AS IF THE NAILS WERE LOOSE AND AS IF THEY COULD BE SHAKEN OFF BURNING IN THE TIPS OF FINGERS AS FROM FIRE FINE BURNING STINGING IN THE TIPS OF THE FINGERS
7398-98878-0025 BURNING AROUND A HANG NAIL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE FOURTH FINGER OF THE RIGHT HAND WITH PAIN INTERNALLY WITHOUT REDNESS AND WITHOUT AGGRAVATION FROM PRESSURE WITH CONTINUAL BURNING IN THE TIP SWELLING OF THE FINGERS WHICH REMAINED PAINFUL FOR SEVERAL DAYS
7398-98878-0026 BLISTER AT THE TIP OF THE RIGHT INDEX DISCHARGING A BLOODY ICHOR WHEN OPENED AND AFTERWARDS A MILKY PUS WITH VIOLENT BURNING THROBBING AND GNAWING PAINS CONTINUING TO SPREAD FOR TWO DAYS FROM ALL THIS WE DEDUCE THE HIGHLY IMPORTANT PRACTICAL RULE
7398-98878-0027 IN A CASE OF WHITLOW FIRST ASCERTAIN WHETHER AND HOW FAR SULPHUR HAS BEEN ABUSED BY THE PATIENT UNFORTUNATELY THE NON ABUSE OF SULPHUR IS AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE WHEREAS THE ABUSE OF SULPHUR IS QUITE COMMON EVEN IN OUR AGE
7398-98878-0028 WOULD THAT IN THIS RESPECT THE ANCIENT DARKNESS MIGHT YIELD TO THE NEW LIGHT IN CASE SULPHUR HAD BEEN ABUSED BY THE PATIENT WE MIX A FEW DROPS OF APIS THREE IN TWELVE TABLESPOONFULS OF WATER
7398-98878-0029 THIS TREATMENT HAS TO BE CONTINUED UNTIL THE PAINS CEASE THEY CEASE EITHER BECAUSE THE INFLAMMATION HAS BEEN DISPERSED AND THE MORBID PROCESS IS TERMINATED OR ELSE A HEALTHY SUPPURATION HAS BEEN SET UP
7398-98878-0030 A SIMPLE BREAD AND MILK POULTICE MAY BE USED AS SOOTHING PALLIATIVE ESPECIALLY IF THE EXTERNAL SKIN IS OF A FIRM HARD TEXTURE RESOLUTION MAY BE DEPENDED UPON IN EVERY CASE WHERE APIS HAS BEEN RESORTED TO IN TIME
7398-98878-0031 IN SUCH A CASE WE HAVE AT ONCE TO RESORT TO A VERY HIGH POTENCY OF SULPHUR A SINGLE GLOBULE OF SULPHUR SIX THOUSAND WOULD FREQUENTLY AMELIORATE THE WORST ASPECT OF THE CASE AS BY A MIRACLE
7398-98878-0032 A DROP MORNING AND EVENING WOULD SO IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS AS TO RENDER ALL FURTHER MEDICATION UNNECESSARY IF THE PSORIC MIASM SHOULD BE THE CAUSE OF THE RETARDED IMPROVEMENT AS MAY EASILY BE DETERMINED BY THE PREDISPOSING CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE
7398-98878-0033 AND IF NO SULPHUR SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED PREVIOUSLY
7398-98878-0034 AND TO AT ONCE EXHIBIT A GLOBULE OF SULPHUR THIRTY WHICH MAY BE ALLOWED TO ACT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
