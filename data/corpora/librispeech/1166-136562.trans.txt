1166-136562-0007 WELL ANSWERED THE GIRL STUDENT WITH A THOUGHTFUL LOOK UPON HER FACE YOU SEE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BREAK SOCIETY UP INTO ITS ELEMENTS IN SIX WEEKS SOME OF THE GIRLS DO IT IN SIX WEEKS SOME PUT IN A WHOLE SEMESTER AND TAKE TWELVE WEEKS AT IT
1166-136562-0008 SO AS TO BREAK UP PRETTY THOROUGHLY I SAID YES SHE ASSENTED BUT MOST OF THE GIRLS THINK SIX WEEKS IS ENOUGH THAT OUGHT TO PULVERIZE IT PRETTY COMPLETELY BUT HOW DO YOU GO AT IT
1166-136562-0009 WELL THE GIRL SAID IT'S ALL DONE WITH LABORATORY WORK WE TAKE FOR INSTANCE DEPARTMENT STORES I THINK THAT IS THE FIRST THING WE DO WE TAKE UP THE DEPARTMENT STORE

1166-136562-0011 THE CLASS GOES DOWN WITH THE PROFESSOR TO THE DEPARTMENT STORE ITSELF AND THEN THEN THEY WALK ALL THROUGH IT OBSERVING BUT HAVE NONE OF THEM EVER BEEN IN A DEPARTMENTAL STORE BEFORE OH OF COURSE
1166-136562-0012 BUT YOU SEE WE GO AS OBSERVERS AH NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU MEAN YOU DON'T BUY ANYTHING AND SO YOU ARE ABLE TO WATCH EVERYTHING NO SHE SAID IT'S NOT THAT WE DO BUY THINGS THAT'S PART OF IT MOST OF THE GIRLS LIKE TO BUY LITTLE KNICK KNACKS
1166-136562-0013 BUT WHILE THEY ARE THERE THEY ARE OBSERVING THEN AFTERWARDS THEY MAKE CHARTS CHARTS OF WHAT I ASKED CHARTS OF THE EMPLOYES THEY'RE USED TO SHOW THE BRAIN MOVEMENT INVOLVED DO YOU FIND MUCH
1166-136562-0014 WELL SHE SAID HESITATINGLY THE IDEA IS TO REDUCE ALL THE EMPLOYES TO A CURVE TO A CURVE I EXCLAIMED AN IN OR AN OUT NO NO NOT EXACTLY THAT
1166-136562-0015 DIDN'T YOU USE CURVES WHEN YOU WERE AT COLLEGE NEVER I SAID OH WELL NOWADAYS NEARLY EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IS DONE INTO A CURVE WE PUT THEM ON THE BOARD AND WHAT IS THIS PARTICULAR CURVE OF THE EMPLOYE USED FOR I ASKED

1166-136562-0018 AND WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THAT OH WHEN WE HAVE THAT WE CAN TELL WHAT THE EMPLOYE WOULD DO UNDER ANY AND EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE AT LEAST THAT'S THE IDEA THOUGH I'M REALLY ONLY QUOTING SHE ADDED BREAKING OFF IN A DIFFIDENT WAY
1166-136562-0019 FROM WHAT MISS THINKER THE PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL ENDEAVOUR SAYS SHE'S REALLY FINE SHE'S MAKING A GENERAL CHART OF THE FEMALE EMPLOYES OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST STORES TO SHOW WHAT PERCENTAGE IN CASE OF FIRE WOULD JUMP OUT OF THE WINDOW
1166-136562-0020 AND WHAT PERCENTAGE WOULD RUN TO THE FIRE ESCAPE IT'S A WONDERFUL COURSE I SAID WE HAD NOTHING LIKE IT WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE AND DOES IT ONLY TAKE IN DEPARTMENTAL STORES NO SAID THE GIRL
1166-136562-0021 THE LABORATORY WORK INCLUDES FOR THIS SEMESTER ICE CREAM PARLOURS AS WELL WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM WE TAKE THEM UP AS SOCIAL CELLS NUCLEI I THINK THE PROFESSOR CALLS THEM AND HOW DO YOU GO AT THEM I ASKED
1166-136562-0022 WHY THE GIRLS GO TO THEM IN LITTLE LABORATORY GROUPS AND STUDY THEM THEY EAT ICE CREAM IN THEM THEY HAVE TO SHE SAID TO MAKE IT CONCRETE
1166-136562-0023 BUT WHILE THEY ARE DOING IT THEY ARE CONSIDERING THE ICE CREAM PARLOUR MERELY AS A SECTION OF SOCIAL PROTOPLASM DOES THE PROFESSOR GO I ASKED OH YES SHE HEADS EACH GROUP PROFESSOR THINKER NEVER SPARES HERSELF FROM WORK

1166-136562-0030 I'M AFRAID I'M QUOTING MISS STALK BUT I DON'T MIND SHE'S REALLY FINE IS TO BREAK NATURE INTO ITS ELEMENTS I SEE SO AS TO VIEW IT AS THE EXTERNAL STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY AND MAKE DEDUCTIONS FROM IT HAVE YOU MADE ANY I ASKED
