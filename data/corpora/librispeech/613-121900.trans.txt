613-121900-0000 THEN SAID I WITH ALL MY HEART I AGREE WITH PLATO INDEED THIS IS NOW THE SECOND TIME THAT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO MY MIND FIRST I LOST THEM THROUGH THE CLOGGING CONTACT OF THE BODY
613-121900-0001 THEN AFTER THROUGH THE STRESS OF HEAVY GRIEF THEN SHE CONTINUED IF THOU WILT REFLECT UPON THY FORMER ADMISSIONS IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE THOU DOST ALSO RECOLLECT THAT OF WHICH
613-121900-0002 ERSTWHILE THOU DIDST CONFESS THYSELF IGNORANT WHAT IS THAT SAID I THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WORLD'S GOVERNMENT SAID SHE YES I REMEMBER MY CONFESSION AND
613-121900-0003 ALTHOUGH I NOW ANTICIPATE WHAT THOU INTENDEST I HAVE A DESIRE TO HEAR THE ARGUMENT PLAINLY SET FORTH AWHILE AGO THOU DEEMEDST IT BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT GOD DOTH GOVERN THE WORLD
613-121900-0004 I DO NOT THINK IT DOUBTFUL NOW NOR SHALL I EVER AND BY WHAT REASONS I AM BROUGHT TO THIS ASSURANCE I WILL BRIEFLY SET FORTH
613-121900-0005 AND WHEN IT HAD ONCE COME TOGETHER
613-121900-0006 WERE THERE NOT ONE WHO KEEPS TOGETHER WHAT HE HAS JOINED NOR WOULD THE ORDER OF NATURE PROCEED SO REGULARLY NOR COULD ITS COURSE EXHIBIT MOTIONS SO FIXED IN RESPECT OF POSITION TIME RANGE EFFICACY
613-121900-0007 AND CHARACTER UNLESS THERE WERE ONE WHO HIMSELF ABIDING DISPOSED THESE VARIOUS VICISSITUDES OF CHANGE THIS POWER WHATSOEVER IT BE WHEREBY THEY REMAIN AS THEY WERE CREATED AND ARE KEPT IN MOTION
613-121900-0008 I CALL BY THE NAME WHICH ALL RECOGNISE GOD THEN SAID SHE SEEING THAT SUCH IS THY BELIEF IT WILL COST ME LITTLE TROUBLE I THINK TO ENABLE THEE TO WIN HAPPINESS AND RETURN IN SAFETY TO THY OWN COUNTRY
613-121900-0009 BUT LET US GIVE OUR ATTENTION TO THE TASK THAT WE HAVE SET BEFORE OURSELVES HAVE WE NOT COUNTED INDEPENDENCE IN THE CATEGORY OF HAPPINESS AND AGREED THAT GOD IS ABSOLUTE HAPPINESS TRULY WE HAVE THEN
613-121900-0010 HE WILL NEED NO EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE RULING OF THE WORLD OTHERWISE IF HE STANDS IN NEED OF AUGHT HE WILL NOT POSSESS COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE THAT IS NECESSARILY SO SAID I THEN
613-121900-0011 BY HIS OWN POWER ALONE HE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IT CANNOT BE DENIED NOW GOD WAS PROVED TO BE ABSOLUTE GOOD
613-121900-0012 THEN HE DISPOSES ALL THINGS BY THE AGENCY OF GOOD IF IT BE TRUE THAT HE RULES ALL THINGS BY HIS OWN POWER WHOM WE HAVE AGREED TO BE GOOD AND HE IS AS IT WERE THE RUDDER AND HELM BY WHICH THE WORLD'S MECHANISM IS KEPT STEADY AND IN ORDER
613-121900-0013 HEARTILY DO I AGREE AND INDEED I ANTICIPATED WHAT THOU WOULDST SAY THOUGH IT MAY BE IN FEEBLE SURMISE ONLY I WELL BELIEVE IT SAID SHE FOR AS I THINK
613-121900-0014 THOU NOW BRINGEST TO THE SEARCH EYES QUICKER IN DISCERNING TRUTH BUT WHAT I SHALL SAY NEXT IS NO LESS PLAIN AND EASY TO SEE WHAT IS IT SAID I WHY SAID SHE
613-121900-0015 SINCE GOD IS RIGHTLY BELIEVED TO GOVERN ALL THINGS WITH THE RUDDER OF GOODNESS AND SINCE ALL THINGS DO LIKEWISE AS I HAVE TAUGHT HASTE TOWARDS GOOD BY THE VERY AIM OF NATURE CAN IT BE DOUBTED THAT HIS GOVERNANCE IS WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
613-121900-0016 NECESSARILY SO SAID I NO RULE WOULD SEEM HAPPY IF IT WERE A YOKE IMPOSED ON RELUCTANT WILLS AND NOT THE SAFE KEEPING OF OBEDIENT SUBJECTS THERE IS NOTHING THEN WHICH
613-121900-0017 WHILE IT FOLLOWS NATURE ENDEAVOURS TO RESIST GOOD NO NOTHING BUT IF ANYTHING SHOULD WILL IT HAVE THE LEAST SUCCESS AGAINST HIM WHOM WE RIGHTLY AGREED TO BE SUPREME LORD OF HAPPINESS
613-121900-0018 IT WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOTENT THERE IS NOTHING THEN WHICH HAS EITHER THE WILL OR THE POWER TO OPPOSE THIS SUPREME GOOD NO I THINK NOT SO THEN
613-121900-0019 SAID SHE IT IS THE SUPREME GOOD WHICH RULES IN STRENGTH AND GRACIOUSLY DISPOSES ALL THINGS THEN SAID I HOW DELIGHTED AM I AT THY REASONINGS AND THE CONCLUSION TO WHICH THOU HAST BROUGHT THEM
613-121900-0020 BUT MOST OF ALL AT THESE VERY WORDS WHICH THOU USEST I AM NOW AT LAST ASHAMED OF THE FOLLY THAT SO SORELY VEXED ME THOU HAST HEARD THE STORY OF THE GIANTS ASSAILING HEAVEN
613-121900-0021 OF MUTUAL COLLISION IT MAY BE FROM THE IMPACT SOME FAIR SPARK OF TRUTH MAY BE STRUCK OUT IF IT BE THY GOOD PLEASURE SAID I NO ONE CAN DOUBT THAT GOD IS ALL POWERFUL
613-121900-0022 NO ONE AT ALL CAN QUESTION IT WHO THINKS CONSISTENTLY NOW THERE IS NOTHING WHICH ONE WHO IS ALL POWERFUL CANNOT DO NOTHING BUT CAN GOD DO EVIL THEN
613-121900-0023 NAY BY NO MEANS THEN EVIL IS NOTHING SAID SHE SINCE HE TO WHOM NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IS UNABLE TO DO EVIL ART THOU MOCKING ME SAID I
613-121900-0024 WEAVING A LABYRINTH OF TANGLED ARGUMENTS NOW SEEMING TO BEGIN WHERE THOU DIDST END AND NOW TO END WHERE THOU DIDST BEGIN OR DOST THOU BUILD UP SOME WONDROUS CIRCLE OF DIVINE SIMPLICITY FOR TRULY
613-121900-0025 A LITTLE BEFORE THOU DIDST BEGIN WITH HAPPINESS AND SAY IT WAS THE SUPREME GOOD AND DIDST DECLARE IT TO BE SEATED IN THE SUPREME GODHEAD GOD HIMSELF TOO
613-121900-0026 AND FROM THIS THOU DIDST GO ON TO ADD AS BY THE WAY THE PROOF THAT NO ONE WOULD BE HAPPY UNLESS HE WERE LIKEWISE GOD AGAIN THOU DIDST SAY THAT THE VERY FORM OF GOOD WAS THE ESSENCE BOTH OF GOD
613-121900-0027 AND OF HAPPINESS AND DIDST TEACH THAT THE ABSOLUTE ONE WAS THE ABSOLUTE GOOD WHICH WAS SOUGHT BY UNIVERSAL NATURE
613-121900-0028 THOU DIDST MAINTAIN ALSO THAT GOD RULES THE UNIVERSE BY THE GOVERNANCE OF GOODNESS THAT ALL THINGS OBEY HIM WILLINGLY AND THAT EVIL HAS NO EXISTENCE IN NATURE AND ALL THIS
613-121900-0029 THOU DIDST UNFOLD WITHOUT THE HELP OF ASSUMPTIONS FROM WITHOUT BUT BY INHERENT AND PROPER PROOFS DRAWING CREDENCE ONE FROM THE OTHER THEN ANSWERED SHE FAR IS IT FROM ME TO MOCK THEE NAY
613-121900-0030 BY THE BLESSING OF GOD WHOM WE LATELY ADDRESSED IN PRAYER
613-121900-0031 FOR SUCH IS THE FORM OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE THAT NEITHER CAN IT PASS INTO THINGS EXTERNAL NOR TAKE UP ANYTHING EXTERNAL INTO ITSELF BUT AS PARMENIDES SAYS OF IT
613-121900-0032 IN BODY LIKE TO A SPHERE ON ALL SIDES PERFECTLY ROUNDED IT ROLLS THE RESTLESS ORB OF THE UNIVERSE KEEPING ITSELF MOTIONLESS THE WHILE
613-121900-0033 AND IF I HAVE ALSO EMPLOYED REASONINGS NOT DRAWN FROM WITHOUT BUT LYING WITHIN THE COMPASS OF OUR SUBJECT THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR THEE TO MARVEL SINCE THOU HAST LEARNT ON PLATO'S AUTHORITY THAT WORDS OUGHT TO BE AKIN TO THE MATTER OF WHICH THEY TREAT
613-121900-0034 BESIDE THE FOUNT OF GOOD BLEST HE WHOSE WILL COULD BREAK EARTH'S CHAINS FOR WISDOM'S SAKE THE THRACIAN BARD TIS SAID MOURNED HIS DEAR CONSORT DEAD
613-121900-0035 TO HEAR THE PLAINTIVE STRAIN THE WOODS MOVED IN HIS TRAIN AND THE STREAM CEASED TO FLOW HELD BY SO SOFT A

613-121900-0041 BRIEF DOTH FEEL FOR LO THE WHEEL STANDS STILL AND WHILE THOSE SAD NOTES THRILL THIRST MADDENED TANTALUS LISTENS OBLIVIOUS OF THE STREAM'S MOCKERY AND HIS LONG AGONY

613-121900-0043 SATED AND PACIFIED AT LENGTH THE SHADOWY KING HIS SORROWS PITYING HE HATH PREVAILED CRIED WE GIVE HIM BACK HIS BRIDE TO HIM SHE SHALL BELONG
613-121900-0044 OF HIS SONG ONE SOLE CONDITION YET UPON THE BOON IS SET LET HIM NOT TURN HIS EYES TO VIEW HIS HARD WON PRIZE TILL THEY SECURELY PASS THE GATES OF HELL ALAS WHAT LAW
