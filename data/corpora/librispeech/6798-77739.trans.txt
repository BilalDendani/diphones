6798-77739-0000 WHY DIDN'T SHE HELP US AGAINST THE ITALIANS DURING THE WAR FOR TRIPOLI THEY SAID NOW THAT SHE IS IN TROUBLE SHE IS DRAWING US INTO THE FIGHT THEIR OPINIONS HOWEVER SOON UNDERWENT A CHANGE IN THE FIRST PLACE
6798-77739-0001 THEY CAME TO REALIZE THAT TURKEY HAD TAKEN UP ARMS AGAINST RUSSIA AND RUSSIA IS CONSIDERED FIRST AND FOREMOST THE ARCH ENEMY
6798-77739-0002 ALSO HAD A POWERFUL EFFECT ON THEM THEY BEGAN TO GROW BOASTFUL ARROGANT
6798-77739-0003 AND CHRISTIANS CONVINCED THEM THAT A VERY DESIRABLE REGIME WAS SETTING IN
6798-77739-0004 AND IT WAS TORMENT FOR ME TO HAVE TO WITNESS THE OUTRAGES THAT MY PEOPLE SUFFERED IN THE NAME OF REQUISITIONING THE FINAL BLOW CAME ONE MORNING WHEN ALL THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS OF OUR REGIMENT WERE CALLED OUT AND TOLD THAT HENCEFORTH
6798-77739-0005 IN THE TABOOR AMLIEH OR WORKING CORPS THE OBJECT OF THIS ACTION PLAINLY ENOUGH WAS TO CONCILIATE AND FLATTER THE MOHAMMEDAN POPULATION AND AT THE SAME TIME TO PUT THE JEWS AND CHRISTIANS
6798-77739-0006 AND WE BECAME HARD DRIVEN GANGSTERS I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE HUMILIATION OF THAT DAY WHEN WE WHO AFTER ALL WERE THE BEST DISCIPLINED TROOPS OF THE LOT WERE FIRST HERDED TO OUR WORK OF PUSHING WHEELBARROWS AND HANDLING SPADES
6798-77739-0007 BY GRINNING ARABS RIFLE ON SHOULDER
6798-77739-0008 ON THE SEA OF GALILEE A LINK IN THE MILITARY HIGHWAY FROM DAMASCUS TO THE COAST WHICH WOULD BE USED FOR THE MOVEMENT OF TROOPS IN CASE THE RAILROAD SHOULD BE CUT OFF
6798-77739-0009 IT HAD NO IMMEDIATE STRATEGIC BEARING ON THE ATTACK AGAINST SUEZ HOWEVER FROM SIX IN THE MORNING TILL SEVEN AT NIGHT WE WERE HARD AT IT EXCEPT FOR ONE HOUR'S REST AT NOON
6798-77739-0010 WHILE WE HAD MONEY IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GET SOME SLIGHT RELIEF BY BRIBING OUR TASKMASTERS BUT THIS SOON CAME TO AN END
6798-77739-0011 THE WHEELBARROWS WE USED WERE THE PROPERTY OF A FRENCH COMPANY
6798-77739-0012 NO GREASE WAS PROVIDED FOR THE WHEELS SO THAT THERE WAS A MADDENING SQUEAKING AND SQUEALING IN ADDITION TO THE DIFFICULTY OF PUSHING THE BARROWS ONE DAY I SUGGESTED TO AN INSPECTION OFFICER
6798-77739-0013 HE AGREED WITH ME AND ISSUED AN ORDER THAT THE MEN WERE TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN OIL TO LUBRICATE THE WHEELS I SHALL NOT DWELL ON THE PHYSICAL SUFFERINGS WE UNDERWENT WHILE WORKING ON THIS ROAD
6798-77739-0014 FOR THE REASON THAT THE CONDITIONS I HAVE DESCRIBED WERE PREVALENT OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND LATER WHEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT SOME CONSTRUCTION CAMPS IN SAMARIA AND JUDAEA FOUND THAT IN COMPARISON OUR LOT HAD BEEN A HAPPY ONE
6798-77739-0015 WHILE WE WERE BREAKING STONES AND TRUNDLING SQUEAKING WHEELBARROWS HOWEVER THE MOST DISQUIETING RUMORS BEGAN TO DRIFT IN TO US FROM OUR HOME VILLAGES PLUNDERING HAD BEEN GOING ON IN THE NAME OF REQUISITIONING
6798-77739-0016 THE COUNTRY WAS FULL OF SOLDIERY WHOSE CAPACITY FOR MISCHIEF MAKING WAS WELL KNOWN TO US AND IT WAS TORTURE TO THINK OF WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING IN OUR PEACEFUL HOMES WHERE SO FEW MEN HAD BEEN LEFT FOR PROTECTION
6798-77739-0017 ALL THE BARBED WIRE FENCES WE HEARD HAD BEEN TORN UP
6798-77739-0018 IN A WILD LAND LIKE PALESTINE WHERE THE NATIVE HAS NO RESPECT FOR PROPERTY WHERE FIELDS AND CROPS ARE ALWAYS AT THE MERCY OF MARAUDERS THE BARBED WIRE FENCE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS FACTOR FOR CIVILIZATION
6798-77739-0019 AND WITH THESE GONE THE ARABS WERE ONCE MORE FREE TO SWEEP ACROSS THE COUNTRY UNHINDERED STEALING AND DESTROYING THE SITUATION GREW MORE AND MORE UNBEARABLE ONE DAY A LITTLE CHRISTIAN SOLDIER
6798-77739-0020 DISAPPEARED FROM THE RANKS WE NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN BUT WE LEARNED THAT HIS SISTER A VERY YOUNG GIRL HAD BEEN FORCIBLY TAKEN BY A TURKISH OFFICER OF THE NAZARETH GARRISON IN PALESTINE THE DISHONOR OF A GIRL CAN BE REDEEMED BY BLOOD ALONE
6798-77739-0021 HE THEN SURRENDERED HIMSELF TO THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES WHO UNDOUBTEDLY PUT HIM TO DEATH
6798-77739-0022 FOR HE KNEW THAT THIS WOULD NOT ONLY BRING DEATH TO HIS FAMILY
6798-77739-0023 I DETERMINED TO GET OUT OF THE ARMY AND RETURN TO MY VILLAGE AT ALL COSTS NINE TURKISH OFFICERS OUT OF TEN CAN BE BOUGHT
6798-77739-0024 NOW ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY
6798-77739-0025 BUT EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN TURKEY I SET TO WORK AND IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS I HAD BOUGHT HALF A DOZEN OFFICERS RANGING FROM CORPORAL TO CAPTAIN AND HAD OBTAINED CONSENT OF THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES TO MY DEPARTURE PROVIDED
6798-77739-0026 I COULD GET A PHYSICIAN'S CERTIFICATE DECLARING ME UNFIT FOR SERVICE THIS WAS ARRANGED IN SHORT ORDER ALTHOUGH I AM HEALTHY LOOKING AND THE DOCTOR FOUND SOME DIFFICULTY IN HITTING ON AN APPROPRIATE AILMENT FINALLY HE DECIDED THAT I HAD TOO MUCH BLOOD
6798-77739-0027 WHATEVER THAT MIGHT MEAN WITH HIS CERTIFICATE IN HAND I PAID THE REGULAR PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM FUNDS WHICH HAD BEEN SENT ME BY MY FAMILY AND WALKED OUT OF THE BARRACKS A FREE MAN
6798-77739-0028 MY HAPPINESS WAS MINGLED WITH SADNESS AT THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING THE COMRADES WITH WHOM I HAD SUFFERED AND HOPED THE FOUR BOYS FROM MY VILLAGE WERE SPLENDID THEY FELT THAT I WAS RIGHT IN GOING HOME
6798-77739-0029 BUT WHEN THEY KISSED ME GOOD BYE IN THE EASTERN FASHION THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN THEIR CHEEKS AND THEY WERE ALL STRONG BRAVE FELLOWS ON MY WAY BACK TO ZICRON JACOB I PASSED THROUGH THE TOWN OF SHEFF'AMR
6798-77739-0030 WHERE I GOT A FORETASTE OF THE CONDITIONS I WAS TO FIND AT HOME A TURKISH SOLDIER SAUNTERING ALONG THE STREET HELPED HIMSELF TO FRUIT FROM THE BASKET OF AN OLD VENDER AND WENT ON WITHOUT OFFERING TO PAY A FARTHING WHEN THE OLD MAN VENTURED TO PROTEST
6798-77739-0031 THE SOLDIER TURNED LIKE A FLASH AND BEGAN BEATING HIM MERCILESSLY KNOCKING HIM DOWN AND BATTERING HIM UNTIL HE WAS BRUISED BLEEDING AND COVERED WITH THE MUD OF THE STREET THERE WAS A HUBBUB A CROWD FORMED THROUGH WHICH A TURKISH OFFICER FORCED HIS WAY DEMANDING EXPLANATIONS
