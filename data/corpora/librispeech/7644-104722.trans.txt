7644-104722-0000 THE CHANCE IS WROTE MISTER ADAMS THAT BEFORE THAT TIME THE WHOLE NEGOTIATION WILL BE AT AN END THE BANQUET HOWEVER DID COME OFF AND A FEW MORE SUCCEEDED IT
7644-104722-0001 LIKE ALARMS WERE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE EVEN ALMOST TO THE VERY DAY OF AGREEMENT ON SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH AT A DINNER GIVEN BY THE AMERICAN COMMISSIONERS
7644-104722-0002 LORD GAMBIER ASKED MISTER ADAMS WHETHER HE WOULD RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO SAINT PETERSBURG YES REPLIED MISTER ADAMS THAT IS IF YOU SEND US AWAY HIS LORDSHIP REPLIED WITH ASSURANCES HOW DEEPLY HE LAMENTED IT
7644-104722-0003 AND WITH A HOPE THAT WE SHOULD ONE DAY BE FRIENDS AGAIN ON THE SAME OCCASION MISTER GOULBURN SAID THAT PROBABLY THE LAST NOTE OF THE AMERICANS WOULD TERMINATE THE BUSINESS AND THAT THEY MUST FIGHT IT OUT
7644-104722-0004 FIGHTING IT OUT WAS A MUCH LESS PAINFUL PROSPECT FOR GREAT BRITAIN JUST AT THAT JUNCTURE THAN FOR THE UNITED STATES AS THE AMERICANS REALIZED WITH PROFOUND ANXIETY WE SO FONDLY CLING TO THE VAIN HOPE OF PEACE
7644-104722-0005 THAT EVERY NEW PROOF OF ITS IMPOSSIBILITY OPERATES UPON US AS A DISAPPOINTMENT WROTE MISTER ADAMS
7644-104722-0006 THAT I WAS PREPARED TO TAKE ON ME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRESPASSING UPON THEIR INSTRUCTIONS THUS FAR NOT ONLY SO BUT I WOULD AT THIS MOMENT CHEERFULLY GIVE MY LIFE FOR A PEACE ON THIS BASIS IF PEACE WAS POSSIBLE IT WOULD BE ON NO OTHER
7644-104722-0007 I HAD INDEED NO HOPE THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE ACCEPTED MISTER CLAY THOUGHT THAT THE BRITISH WOULD LAUGH AT THIS THEY WOULD SAY AY AY PRETTY FELLOWS YOU TO THINK OF GETTING OUT OF THE WAR AS WELL AS YOU GOT INTO IT
7644-104722-0008 BUT THAT MISTER ADAMS CORRECTLY READ THE WISHES OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS PROVED WITHIN A VERY FEW DAYS BY THE RECEIPT OF EXPRESS AUTHORITY FROM HOME TO CONCLUDE THE PEACE ON THE BASIS OF THE STATUS ANTE BELLUM
7644-104722-0009 THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH THREE AND A HALF MONTHS AFTER THE VEXATIOUS HAGGLING HAD BEEN BEGUN WE ENCOUNTER IN THE DIARY THE FIRST REAL GLEAM OF HOPE OF A SUCCESSFUL TERMINATION
7644-104722-0010 ALL THE DIFFICULTIES TO THE CONCLUSION OF A PEACE APPEAR TO BE NOW SO NEARLY REMOVED
7644-104722-0011 I MYSELF THINK IT PROBABLE THERE WERE HOWEVER SOME THREE WEEKS MORE OF NEGOTIATION TO BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE THE CONSUMMATION WAS ACTUALLY ACHIEVED AND THE ILL BLOOD SEEMED TO INCREASE AS THE END WAS APPROACHED
7644-104722-0012 THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMERICAN COMMISSIONERS WAXED ESPECIALLY SERIOUS CONCERNING THE FISHERIES AND THE NAVIGATION OF THE MISSISSIPPI MISTER ADAMS INSISTED THAT IF THE TREATY OF PEACE HAD BEEN SO FAR ABROGATED BY THE WAR
7644-104722-0013 AS TO RENDER NECESSARY A RE AFFIRMANCE OF THE BRITISH RIGHT OF NAVIGATING THE MISSISSIPPI THEN A RE AFFIRMANCE OF THE AMERICAN RIGHTS IN THE NORTHEASTERN FISHERIES WAS EQUALLY NECESSARY THIS THE ENGLISH COMMISSIONERS DENIED
7644-104722-0014 MISTER ADAMS SAID IT WAS ONLY AN EXCHANGE OF PRIVILEGES PRESUMABLY EQUIVALENT MISTER CLAY HOWEVER WAS FIRMLY RESOLVED TO PREVENT ALL STIPULATIONS ADMITTING SUCH A RIGHT OF NAVIGATION
7644-104722-0015 AND THE BETTER TO DO SO HE WAS QUITE WILLING TO LET THE FISHERIES GO THE NAVIGATION PRIVILEGE HE CONSIDERED MUCH TOO IMPORTANT TO BE CONCEDED FOR THE MERE LIBERTY OF DRYING FISH UPON A DESERT
7644-104722-0016 AS HE WAS PLEASED TO DESCRIBE A RIGHT FOR WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS OFTEN BEEN READY TO GO TO WAR AND MAY YET SOME TIME DO SO MISTER CLAY LOST HIS TEMPER WRITES MISTER ADAMS A DAY OR TWO LATER
7644-104722-0017 HE WAS UTTERLY AVERSE TO ADMITTING IT AS AN EQUIVALENT FOR A STIPULATION SECURING THE CONTESTED PART OF THE FISHERIES HE SAID THE MORE HE HEARD OF THIS THE RIGHT OF FISHING THE MORE CONVINCED HE WAS THAT IT WAS OF LITTLE OR NO VALUE
7644-104722-0018 HE SHOULD BE GLAD TO GET IT IF HE COULD BUT HE WAS SURE THE BRITISH WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY GRANT IT THAT THE NAVIGATION OF THE MISSISSIPPI ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN OBJECT OF IMMENSE IMPORTANCE AND HE COULD SEE NO SORT OF REASON FOR GRANTING IT AS AN EQUIVALENT FOR THE FISHERIES
7644-104722-0019 THUS SPOKE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WEST THE NEW ENGLANDER THE SON OF THE MAN WHOSE EXERTIONS HAD BEEN CHIEFLY INSTRUMENTAL IN ORIGINALLY OBTAINING THE GRANT OF THE NORTHEASTERN FISHERY PRIVILEGES
7644-104722-0020 NATURALLY WENT TO THE OTHER EXTREME HE THOUGHT THE BRITISH RIGHT OF NAVIGATING THE MISSISSIPPI TO BE AS NOTHING CONSIDERED AS A GRANT FROM US IT WAS SECURED TO THEM BY THE PEACE OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE THEY HAD ENJOYED IT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR
7644-104722-0021 MISTER ADAMS REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST INESTIMABLE AND INALIENABLE OF AMERICAN RIGHTS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE UNITED STATES COULD ILL HAVE SPARED EITHER MISTER ADAMS OR MISTER CLAY FROM THE NEGOTIATION
7644-104722-0022 AND THE JOINDER OF THE TWO HOWEVER FRAUGHT WITH DISCOMFORT TO THEMSELVES WELL SERVED SUBSTANTIAL AMERICAN INTERESTS MISTER ADAMS THOUGHT THE BRITISH PERFIDIOUS
7644-104722-0023 AND SUSPECTED THEM OF NOT ENTERTAINING ANY HONEST INTENTION OF CONCLUDING A PEACE ON DECEMBER TWELFTH AFTER AN EXCEEDINGLY QUARRELSOME CONFERENCE HE RECORDS HIS BELIEF THAT THE BRITISH HAVE INSIDIOUSLY KEPT OPEN TWO POINTS
7644-104722-0024 FOR THE SAKE OF FINALLY BREAKING OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS AND MAKING ALL THEIR OTHER CONCESSIONS PROOFS OF THEIR EXTREME MODERATION TO PUT UPON US THE BLAME OF THE RUPTURE
7644-104722-0025 ON DECEMBER ELEVENTH WE FIND MISTER CLAY READY FOR A WAR THREE YEARS LONGER AND ANXIOUS TO BEGIN TO PLAY AT BRAG WITH THE ENGLISHMEN HIS COLLEAGUES MORE COMPLAISANT OR HAVING LESS CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN SKILL IN THAT GAME
7644-104722-0026 BUT THE QUESTION WHETHER THE BRITISH SHOULD RESTORE POSSESSION OF THE ISLAND PENDING THE ARBITRATION AROUSED BITTER DISCUSSION MISTER GOULBURN AND DOCTOR ADAMS THE ENGLISHMAN IMMEDIATELY TOOK FIRE AND GOULBURN LOST ALL CONTROL OF HIS TEMPER
7644-104722-0027 HE HAS ALWAYS IN SUCH CASES SAYS THE DIARY A SORT OF CONVULSIVE AGITATION ABOUT HIM AND THE TONE IN WHICH HE SPEAKS IS MORE INSULTING THAN THE LANGUAGE WHICH HE USES MISTER BAYARD REFERRED TO THE CASE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS
7644-104722-0028 WHY IN A TRANSPORT OF RAGE SAID GOULBURN IN THAT CASE WE SENT A FLEET AND TROOPS AND DROVE THE FELLOWS OFF AND THAT IS WHAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE IN THIS CASE
7644-104722-0029 STATED THAT AS HE REMEMBERED IT
7644-104722-0030 THOUGH THE PARTY WAS MORE THAN USUALLY DULL STIFF AND RESERVED IT WAS CERTAINLY FORCING THE SPIRIT OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP THE NEXT DAY MISTER CLAY NOTIFIED HIS COLLEAGUES THAT THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE A DAMNED BAD TREATY AND HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WOULD SIGN IT OR NOT
7644-104722-0031 AND MISTER ADAMS ALSO SAID THAT HE SAW THAT THE REST HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS AT LAST TO YIELD THE FISHERY POINT IN WHICH CASE HE ALSO COULD NOT SIGN THE TREATY
7644-104722-0032 WHEREIN THEY MADE THE SUBSTANTIAL CONCESSION OF OMITTING FROM THE TREATY ALL REFERENCE TO THE FISHERIES AND THE NAVIGATION OF THE MISSISSIPPI BUT MISTER CLAY ON READING THE NOTE MANIFESTED SOME CHAGRIN AND STILL TALKED OF BREAKING OFF THE NEGOTIATION
7644-104722-0033 EVEN ASKING MISTER ADAMS TO JOIN HIM IN SO DOING WHICH REQUEST HOWEVER MISTER ADAMS VERY REASONABLY REFUSED
7644-104722-0034 MISTER CLAY HAD ALSO BEEN ANXIOUS TO STAND OUT FOR A DISTINCT ABANDONMENT OF THE ALLEGED RIGHT OF IMPRESSMENT BUT UPON THIS POINT HE FOUND NONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES READY TO BACK HIM
7644-104722-0035 AS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER IN GHENT DISSENSION SEEMED TO HAVE BECOME THE MOTHER OF AMITY AND ANTIPATHIES WERE MERE PRELIMINARIES TO A GOOD UNDERSTANDING
7644-104722-0036 IN DIPLOMACY AS IN MARRIAGE IT HAD WORKED WELL TO BEGIN WITH A LITTLE AVERSION BUT IN TRUTH THIS CONSUMMATION WAS LARGELY DUE TO WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON IN THE ENGLISH CABINET
7644-104722-0037 AND HIS DISPOSITION HAD FOUND EXPRESSION IN THE ORIGINAL INTOLERABLE TERMS PREPARED BY THE BRITISH COMMISSIONERS BUT LORD LIVERPOOL HAD BEEN EQUALLY SOLICITOUS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND WAS SAID EVEN TO HAVE TENDERED HIS RESIGNATION TO THE PRINCE REGENT
7644-104722-0038 IF AN ACCOMMODATION SHOULD NOT BE EFFECTED HIS ENDEAVORS WERE FORTUNATELY AIDED BY EVENTS IN EUROPE PENDING THE NEGOTIATIONS LORD CASTLEREAGH WENT ON A DIPLOMATIC ERRAND TO VIENNA
7644-104722-0039 UNTIL THAT TITLE SHOULD BE SETTLED BY COMMISSIONERS PROVISION WAS MADE ALSO FOR THE DETERMINATION OF ALL THE OPEN QUESTIONS OF BOUNDARY BY SUNDRY BOARDS OF COMMISSIONERS EACH PARTY WAS TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE INDIAN ALLIES OF THE OTHER
7644-104722-0040 SUCH WERE IN SUBSTANCE THE ONLY POINTS TOUCHED UPON BY THIS DOCUMENT OF THE MANY SUBJECTS MOOTED BETWEEN THE NEGOTIATORS SCARCELY ANY HAD SURVIVED THE FIERCE CONTESTS WHICH HAD BEEN WAGED CONCERNING THEM
7644-104722-0041 THE WHOLE MATTER OF THE NAVIGATION OF THE MISSISSIPPI ACCESS TO THAT RIVER
7644-104722-0042 NOR WAS ANY ONE OF THE MANY ILLEGAL RIGHTS EXERCISED BY ENGLAND FORMALLY ABANDONED THE AMERICANS SATISFIED THEMSELVES WITH THE REFLECTION THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAD RENDERED THESE POINTS NOW ONLY MATTERS OF ABSTRACT PRINCIPLE
7644-104722-0043 SINCE THE PACIFICATION OF EUROPE HAD REMOVED ALL OPPORTUNITIES AND TEMPTATIONS FOR ENGLAND TO PERSIST IN HER PREVIOUS OBJECTIONABLE COURSES FOR THE FUTURE IT WAS HARDLY TO BE FEARED THAT SHE WOULD AGAIN UNDERTAKE TO PURSUE A POLICY
7644-104722-0044 AGAINST WHICH IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE UNITED STATES WERE WILLING TO CONDUCT A SERIOUS WAR THERE WAS HOWEVER NO PROVISION FOR INDEMNIFICATION
7644-104722-0045 UPON A FAIR CONSIDERATION IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THOUGH THE TREATY WAS SILENT UPON ALL THE POINTS WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAD MADE WAR FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENFORCING
7644-104722-0046 YET THE COUNTRY HAD EVERY REASON TO BE GRATIFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE NEGOTIATION THE FIVE COMMISSIONERS HAD DONE THEMSELVES AMPLE CREDIT THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN AGREEING WITH EACH OTHER
7644-104722-0047 OR THAT THE NEGOTIATION HAD FALLEN A LITTLE LATER
7644-104722-0048 WHO HAD FOR THREE MONTHS BEEN ENJOYING THE MALICIOUS PLEASURE OF LENDING TO THE AMERICANS ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS CONTAINING ACCOUNTS OF AMERICAN MISFORTUNES BUT THAT FORTUNATE BATTLE WAS NOT FOUGHT UNTIL A FEW DAYS AFTER THE EIGHT COMMISSIONERS HAD SIGNED THEIR COMPACT
7644-104722-0049 IT IS AN INTERESTING ILLUSTRATION OF THE SLOWNESS OF COMMUNICATION WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS HAD TO ENDURE THAT THE TREATY CROSSED THE ATLANTIC IN A SAILING SHIP IN TIME TO TRAVEL THROUGH MUCH OF THE COUNTRY
7644-104722-0050 SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE REPORT OF THIS FAREWELL VICTORY TWO SUCH GOOD PIECES OF NEWS COMING TOGETHER SET THE PEOPLE WILD WITH DELIGHT EVEN ON THE DRY PAGES OF NILES'S WEEKLY REGISTER
7644-104722-0051 THAN IN EXALTING THE COMMISSIONERS THE VALUE OF THEIR WORK HOWEVER WAS WELL PROVED BY THE VOICE OF GREAT BRITAIN IN THE LONDON TIMES OF DECEMBER THIRTIETH APPEARED A MOST ANGRY TIRADE AGAINST THE TREATY
7644-104722-0052 WITH BITTER SNEERS AT THOSE WHO CALLED THE PEACE AN HONORABLE ONE ENGLAND IT WAS SAID HAD ATTEMPTED TO FORCE HER PRINCIPLES ON AMERICA AND HAD FAILED FOREIGN POWERS WOULD SAY THAT THE ENGLISH HAD RETIRED FROM THE COMBAT
7644-104722-0053 WITH THE STRIPES YET BLEEDING ON THEIR BACKS WITH THE RECENT DEFEATS AT PLATTSBURGH AND ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN UNAVENGED
7644-104722-0054 THE MOST GLOOMY PROGNOSTICATIONS OF FURTHER WARS WITH AMERICA WHEN HER NAVAL POWER SHOULD HAVE WAXED MUCH GREATER WERE INDULGED THE LOSS OF PRESTIGE IN EUROPE THE PROBABLE LOSS OF OUR TRANS ATLANTIC PROVINCES
7644-104722-0055 WERE AMONG THE RESULTS TO BE ANTICIPATED FROM THIS TREATY INTO WHICH THE ENGLISH COMMISSIONERS HAD BEEN BEGUILED BY THE AMERICANS THESE LATTER WERE REVILED WITH AN ABUSE WHICH WAS REALLY THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENT
7644-104722-0056 THUS HAVING THE GOOD FORTUNE TO WITNESS THE RETURN OF NAPOLEON AND A GREAT PART OF THE EVENTS OF THE FAMOUS HUNDRED DAYS ON MAY TWENTY SIXTH HE ARRIVED IN LONDON WHERE THERE AWAITED HIM IN THE HANDS OF THE BARINGS
7644-104722-0057 HIS FIRST DUTY WAS IN CONNECTION WITH MISTER CLAY AND MISTER GALLATIN TO NEGOTIATE A TREATY OF COMMERCE IN WHICH BUSINESS HE AGAIN MET THE SAME THREE BRITISH COMMISSIONERS BY WHOM THE NEGOTIATIONS AT GHENT HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
7644-104722-0058 OF WHOSE ABILITIES THE GOVERNMENT APPEARED TO ENTERTAIN A BETTER OPINION THAN THE MARQUIS OF WELLESLEY HAD EXPRESSED THIS NEGOTIATION HAD BEEN BROUGHT SO FAR TOWARDS CONCLUSION BY HIS COLLEAGUES BEFORE HIS OWN ARRIVAL THAT MISTER ADAMS HAD LITTLE TO DO IN ASSISTING THEM TO COMPLETE IT
7644-104722-0059 THIS LITTLE HAVING BEEN DONE THEY DEPARTED AND LEFT HIM AS MINISTER AT THE COURT OF SAINT JAMES THUS HE FULFILLED WASHINGTON'S PROPHECY BY REACHING THE HIGHEST RANK IN THE AMERICAN DIPLOMATIC SERVICE
7644-104722-0060 BUT HE SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF HIS STAY SOME SLIGHT REMISSION OF THE SEVERE RESTRICTIONS PLACED BY ENGLAND UPON OUR TRADE WITH HER WEST INDIAN COLONIES
7644-104722-0061 HIS RELATIONS WITH A CABINET IN WHICH THE PRINCIPLES OF CASTLEREAGH AND CANNING PREDOMINATED COULD HARDLY BE CORDIAL YET HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH PERFECT CIVILITY
7644-104722-0062 INDEED HE WAS NOT A MAN WHOM IT WAS EASY EVEN FOR AN ENGLISHMAN TO INSULT HE REMARKS OF CASTLEREAGH AFTER ONE OF HIS FIRST INTERVIEWS WITH THAT NOBLEMAN HIS DEPORTMENT IS SUFFICIENTLY GRACEFUL AND HIS PERSON IS HANDSOME
7644-104722-0063 HIS MANNER WAS COLD BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY REPULSIVE BEFORE HE LEFT HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF HAVING MISTER CANNING SPECIALLY SEEK ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM HE MET OF COURSE MANY DISTINGUISHED AND MANY AGREEABLE PERSONS DURING HIS RESIDENCE
7644-104722-0064 AND PARTOOK OF MANY FESTIVITIES ESPECIALLY OF NUMEROUS CIVIC BANQUETS AT WHICH TOASTS WERE FORMALLY GIVEN IN THE DULLEST ENGLISH FASHION AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO DISPLAY HIS CAPACITY FOR TABLE CLOTH ORATORY AS HE CALLED IT MORE THAN WAS AGREEABLE TO HIM
7644-104722-0065 AND LIVED THERE DURING THE GREATER PART OF HIS STAY IN ENGLAND ONE OF THE STRONGEST REASONS FOR MY REMAINING OUT OF TOWN HE WRITES IS TO ESCAPE THE FREQUENCY OF INVITATIONS AT LATE HOURS WHICH CONSUME SO MUCH PRECIOUS TIME
7644-104722-0066 AND WITH THE PERPETUALLY MORTIFYING CONSCIOUSNESS OF INABILITY TO RETURN THE CIVILITY IN THE SAME MANNER THE REPUBLICAN SIMPLICITY NOT TO SAY POVERTY FORCED UPON AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVES ABROAD
7644-104722-0067 WAS A VERY DIFFERENT MATTER IN THE CENSORIOUS AND UNFRIENDLY SOCIETY OF LONDON FROM WHAT IT HAD BEEN AT THE KINDLY DISPOSED COURT OF SAINT PETERSBURG
7644-104722-0068 ESPECIALLY AT THAT JUNCTURE WAS SUCH AS TO RENDER SOCIAL LIFE INTOLERABLY TRYING TO AN UNDER PAID AMERICAN MINISTER MISTER ADAMS REMAINED IN ENGLAND UNTIL JUNE FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN
7644-104722-0069 WHEN HE SAILED FROM COWES CLOSING FOREVER HIS LONG AND HONORABLE DIPLOMATIC CAREER AND BIDDING HIS LAST FAREWELL TO EUROPE HE RETURNED HOME TO TAKE THE POST OF SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE CABINET OF JAMES MONROE
