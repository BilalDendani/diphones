957-132537-0000 CAN MUSIC'S VOICE CAN BEAUTY'S EYE CAN PAINTING'S GLOWING HAND SUPPLY A CHARM SO SUITED TO MY MIND AS BLOWS THIS HOLLOW GUST OF WIND AS DROPS THIS LITTLE WEEPING RILL
957-132537-0001 IN WHICH AFTER SOME COMMON PLACE CONDOLEMENT AND ADVICE SHE INVITED HER TO THOLOUSE AND ADDED THAT AS HER LATE BROTHER HAD ENTRUSTED EMILY'S EDUCATION TO HER
957-132537-0002 EMILY AT THIS TIME
957-132537-0003 AS THE LATE RESIDENCE OF THOSE WHOM SHE HAD LOST FOR EVER WHERE SHE COULD WEEP UNOBSERVED RETRACE THEIR STEPS AND REMEMBER EACH MINUTE PARTICULAR OF THEIR MANNERS
957-132537-0004 BUT SHE WAS EQUALLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID THE DISPLEASURE OF MADAME CHERON THOUGH HER AFFECTION WOULD NOT SUFFER HER TO QUESTION EVEN A MOMENT THE PROPRIETY OF SAINT AUBERT'S CONDUCT IN APPOINTING MADAME CHERON
957-132537-0005 FOR HER GUARDIAN SHE WAS SENSIBLE THAT THIS STEP HAD MADE HER HAPPINESS DEPEND IN A GREAT DEGREE ON THE HUMOUR OF HER AUNT IN HER REPLY SHE BEGGED PERMISSION TO REMAIN AT PRESENT AT LA VALLEE
957-132537-0006 THESE SHE KNEW WERE NOT TO BE FOUND AT MADAME CHERON'S WHOSE INCLINATIONS LED HER INTO A LIFE OF DISSIPATION WHICH HER AMPLE FORTUNE ENCOURAGED AND HAVING GIVEN HER ANSWER
957-132537-0007 SHE FELT SOMEWHAT MORE AT EASE IN THE FIRST DAYS OF HER AFFLICTION SHE WAS VISITED BY MONSIEUR BARREAUX A SINCERE MOURNER FOR SAINT AUBERT I MAY WELL LAMENT MY FRIEND SAID HE
957-132537-0008 FOR I SHALL NEVER MEET WITH HIS RESEMBLANCE IF I COULD HAVE FOUND SUCH A MAN IN WHAT IS CALLED SOCIETY I SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT IT
957-132537-0009 SEVERAL WEEKS PASSED AWAY IN QUIET RETIREMENT AND EMILY'S AFFLICTION BEGAN TO SOFTEN INTO MELANCHOLY SHE COULD BEAR TO READ THE BOOKS SHE HAD BEFORE READ WITH HER FATHER TO SIT IN HIS CHAIR IN THE LIBRARY
957-132537-0010 TO WATCH THE FLOWERS HIS HAND HAD PLANTED TO AWAKEN THE TONES OF THAT INSTRUMENT HIS FINGERS HAD PRESSED AND SOMETIMES EVEN TO PLAY HIS FAVOURITE AIR WHEN HER MIND HAD RECOVERED FROM THE FIRST SHOCK OF AFFLICTION
957-132537-0011 PERCEIVING THE DANGER OF YIELDING TO INDOLENCE AND THAT ACTIVITY ALONE COULD RESTORE ITS TONE SHE SCRUPULOUSLY ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ALL HER HOURS IN EMPLOYMENT
957-132537-0012 AND IT WAS NOW THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE FULL VALUE OF THE EDUCATION SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM SAINT AUBERT FOR IN CULTIVATING HER UNDERSTANDING HE HAD SECURED HER AN ASYLUM FROM INDOLENCE WITHOUT RECOURSE TO DISSIPATION
957-132537-0013 SAINT AUBERT HAVING NOURISHED EVERY AMIABLE QUALIFY OF HER HEART IT NOW EXPANDED IN BENEVOLENCE TO ALL AROUND HER AND TAUGHT HER WHEN SHE COULD NOT REMOVE THE MISFORTUNES OF OTHERS AT LEAST TO SOFTEN THEM BY SYMPATHY AND TENDERNESS
957-132537-0014 A BENEVOLENCE THAT TAUGHT HER TO FEEL FOR ALL THAT COULD SUFFER MADAME CHERON RETURNED NO ANSWER TO EMILY'S LETTER WHO BEGAN TO HOPE THAT SHE SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN SOME TIME LONGER IN HER RETIREMENT
957-132537-0015 AND HER MIND HAD NOW SO FAR RECOVERED ITS STRENGTH THAT SHE VENTURED TO VIEW THE SCENES WHICH MOST POWERFULLY RECALLED THE IMAGES OF PAST TIMES AMONG THESE WAS THE FISHING HOUSE AND TO INDULGE STILL MORE THE AFFECTIONATE MELANCHOLY OF THE VISIT
957-132537-0016 SHE TOOK THITHER HER LUTE THAT SHE MIGHT AGAIN HEAR THERE THE TONES TO WHICH SAINT AUBERT AND HER MOTHER HAD SO OFTEN DELIGHTED TO LISTEN SHE WENT ALONE AND AT THAT STILL HOUR OF THE EVENING WHICH IS SO SOOTHING TO FANCY AND TO GRIEF
957-132537-0017 THEY AWAKENED SO FORCIBLY THE MEMORY OF FORMER TIMES THAT HER RESOLUTION YIELDED FOR A MOMENT TO EXCESS OF GRIEF SHE STOPPED LEANED FOR SUPPORT AGAINST A TREE AND WEPT FOR SOME MINUTES BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO PROCEED
957-132537-0018 THE LITTLE PATH THAT LED TO THE BUILDING WAS OVERGROWN WITH GRASS AND THE FLOWERS WHICH SAINT AUBERT HAD SCATTERED CARELESSLY ALONG THE BORDER WERE ALMOST CHOKED WITH WEEDS THE TALL THISTLE THE FOX GLOVE AND THE NETTLE
957-132537-0019 THAT BOWED UPON THE BANKS BELOW WAS A KIND OF MUSIC MORE IN UNISON WITH HER FEELINGS IT DID NOT VIBRATE ON THE CHORDS OF UNHAPPY MEMORY BUT WAS SOOTHING TO THE HEART AS THE VOICE OF PITY SHE CONTINUED TO MUSE
957-132537-0020 UNCONSCIOUS OF THE GLOOM OF EVENING AND THAT THE SUN'S LAST LIGHT TREMBLED ON THE HEIGHTS ABOVE AND WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REMAINED SO MUCH LONGER IF A SUDDEN FOOTSTEP WITHOUT THE BUILDING HAD NOT ALARMED HER ATTENTION
957-132537-0021 AT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE LOST HER FEAR IN A STRONGER EMOTION ITS TONES WERE FAMILIAR TO HER EAR AND THOUGH SHE COULD NOT READILY DISTINGUISH THROUGH THE DUSK THE FEATURES OF THE PERSON WHO SPOKE
957-132537-0022 SURELY I AM NOT MISTAKEN MA'AMSELLE SAINT AUBERT IS IT NOT IT IS INDEED SAID EMILY WHO WAS CONFIRMED IN HER FIRST CONJECTURE FOR SHE NOW DISTINGUISHED THE COUNTENANCE OF VALANCOURT
957-132537-0023 LIGHTED UP WITH STILL MORE THAN ITS USUAL ANIMATION A THOUSAND PAINFUL RECOLLECTIONS CROWDED TO HER MIND AND THE EFFORT WHICH SHE MADE TO SUPPORT HERSELF ONLY SERVED TO INCREASE HER AGITATION
957-132537-0024 LEARNED FROM THE FLOOD OF TEARS WHICH SHE COULD NO LONGER REPRESS THE FATAL TRUTH HE LED HER TO A SEAT AND SAT DOWN BY HER WHILE EMILY CONTINUED TO WEEP AND VALANCOURT TO HOLD THE HAND WHICH SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS HE HAD TAKEN
957-132537-0025 TILL IT WAS WET WITH THE TEARS WHICH GRIEF FOR SAINT AUBERT AND SYMPATHY FOR HERSELF HAD CALLED FORTH I FEEL SAID HE AT LENGTH
957-132537-0026 I FEEL HOW INSUFFICIENT ALL ATTEMPT AT CONSOLATION MUST BE ON THIS SUBJECT I CAN ONLY MOURN WITH YOU FOR I CANNOT DOUBT THE SOURCE OF YOUR TEARS WOULD TO GOD I WERE MISTAKEN
957-132537-0027 EMILY COULD STILL ANSWER ONLY BY TEARS TILL SHE ROSE AND BEGGED THEY MIGHT LEAVE THE MELANCHOLY SPOT WHEN VALANCOURT THOUGH HE SAW HER FEEBLENESS COULD NOT OFFER TO DETAIN HER
957-132537-0028 BUT TOOK HER ARM WITHIN HIS AND LED HER FROM THE FISHING HOUSE THEY WALKED SILENTLY THROUGH THE WOODS VALANCOURT ANXIOUS TO KNOW YET FEARING TO ASK ANY PARTICULARS CONCERNING SAINT AUBERT AND EMILY
957-132537-0029 TOO MUCH DISTRESSED TO CONVERSE AFTER SOME TIME HOWEVER SHE ACQUIRED FORTITUDE ENOUGH TO SPEAK OF HER FATHER AND TO GIVE A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH DURING WHICH RECITAL VALANCOURT'S COUNTENANCE BETRAYED STRONG EMOTION
957-132537-0030 AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT SAINT AUBERT HAD DIED ON THE ROAD AND THAT EMILY HAD BEEN LEFT AMONG STRANGERS HE PRESSED HER HAND BETWEEN HIS AND INVOLUNTARILY EXCLAIMED WHY WAS I NOT THERE
957-132537-0031 BUT IN THE NEXT MOMENT RECOLLECTED HIMSELF FOR HE IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE MENTION OF HER FATHER TILL PERCEIVING THAT HER SPIRITS WERE EXHAUSTED HE GRADUALLY CHANGED THE SUBJECT AND SPOKE OF HIMSELF
957-132537-0032 EMILY THUS LEARNED THAT AFTER THEY HAD PARTED HE HAD WANDERED FOR SOME TIME ALONG THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND HAD THEN RETURNED THROUGH LANGUEDOC INTO GASCONY
957-132537-0033 WHICH WAS HIS NATIVE PROVINCE AND WHERE HE USUALLY RESIDED WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED HIS LITTLE NARRATIVE HE SUNK INTO A SILENCE WHICH EMILY WAS NOT DISPOSED TO INTERRUPT AND IT CONTINUED TILL THEY REACHED THE GATE OF THE CHATEAU
957-132537-0034 WHEN HE STOPPED AS IF HE HAD KNOWN THIS TO BE THE LIMIT OF HIS WALK HERE SAYING THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO ESTUVIERE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD PERMIT HIM TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER IN THE MORNING
957-132537-0035 AND EMILY PERCEIVING THAT SHE COULD NOT REJECT AN ORDINARY CIVILITY WITHOUT EXPRESSING BY HER REFUSAL AN EXPECTATION OF SOMETHING MORE WAS COMPELLED TO ANSWER THAT SHE SHOULD BE AT HOME SHE PASSED A MELANCHOLY EVENING
957-132537-0036 DURING WHICH THE RETROSPECT OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE SHE HAD SEEN VALANCOURT WOULD RISE TO HER IMAGINATION AND THE SCENE OF HER FATHER'S DEATH APPEARED IN TINTS AS FRESH AS IF IT HAD PASSED ON THE PRECEDING DAY
957-132537-0037 SHE REMEMBERED PARTICULARLY THE EARNEST AND SOLEMN MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD REQUIRED HER TO DESTROY THE MANUSCRIPT PAPERS AND AWAKENING FROM THE LETHARGY IN WHICH SORROW HAD HELD HER SHE WAS SHOCKED TO THINK SHE HAD NOT YET OBEYED HIM
