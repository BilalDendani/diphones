1092-134563-0000 I CANNOT RECALL WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE FIRST MONTHS AFTER MY ILLNESS I ONLY KNOW THAT I SAT IN MY MOTHER'S LAP OR CLUNG TO HER DRESS AS SHE WENT ABOUT HER HOUSEHOLD DUTIES MY HANDS FELT EVERY OBJECT AND OBSERVED EVERY MOTION AND IN THIS WAY
1092-134563-0001 I LEARNED TO KNOW MANY THINGS SOON I FELT THE NEED OF SOME COMMUNICATION WITH OTHERS AND BEGAN TO MAKE CRUDE SIGNS A SHAKE OF THE HEAD MEANT NO AND A NOD YES A PULL MEANT COME
1092-134563-0002 AND A PUSH GO WAS IT BREAD THAT I WANTED
1092-134563-0003 I MADE THE SIGN FOR WORKING THE FREEZER AND SHIVERED INDICATING COLD MY MOTHER MOREOVER SUCCEEDED IN MAKING ME UNDERSTAND A GOOD DEAL I ALWAYS KNEW WHEN SHE WISHED ME TO BRING HER SOMETHING
1092-134563-0004 AND I WOULD RUN UPSTAIRS OR ANYWHERE ELSE SHE INDICATED INDEED I OWE TO HER LOVING WISDOM ALL THAT WAS BRIGHT AND GOOD IN MY LONG NIGHT I UNDERSTOOD A GOOD DEAL OF WHAT WAS GOING ON ABOUT ME
1092-134563-0005 WHEN THEY WERE BROUGHT IN FROM THE LAUNDRY AND I DISTINGUISHED MY OWN FROM THE REST I KNEW BY THE WAY MY MOTHER AND AUNT DRESSED WHEN THEY WERE GOING OUT AND I INVARIABLY BEGGED TO GO WITH THEM I WAS ALWAYS SENT FOR WHEN THERE WAS COMPANY
1092-134563-0006 ONE DAY SOME GENTLEMEN CALLED ON MY MOTHER AND I FELT THE SHUTTING OF THE FRONT DOOR AND OTHER SOUNDS THAT INDICATED THEIR ARRIVAL ON A SUDDEN THOUGHT
1092-134563-0007 TO PUT ON MY IDEA OF A COMPANY DRESS STANDING BEFORE THE MIRROR AS I HAD SEEN OTHERS DO I ANOINTED MINE HEAD WITH OIL AND COVERED MY FACE THICKLY WITH POWDER THEN I PINNED A VEIL OVER MY HEAD SO THAT IT COVERED MY FACE
1092-134563-0008 AND FELL IN FOLDS DOWN TO MY SHOULDERS
1092-134563-0009 SO THAT IT DANGLED BEHIND ALMOST MEETING THE HEM OF MY SKIRT THUS ATTIRED I WENT DOWN TO HELP ENTERTAIN THE COMPANY I DO NOT REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST REALIZED THAT I WAS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE BUT I KNEW IT BEFORE MY TEACHER CAME TO ME
1092-134563-0010 MY FRIENDS DID NOT USE SIGNS AS I DID WHEN THEY WANTED ANYTHING DONE BUT TALKED WITH THEIR MOUTHS SOMETIMES I STOOD BETWEEN TWO PERSONS WHO WERE CONVERSING AND TOUCHED THEIR LIPS I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND AND WAS VEXED
1092-134563-0011 I MOVED MY LIPS AND GESTICULATED FRANTICALLY WITHOUT RESULT THIS MADE ME SO ANGRY AT TIMES THAT I KICKED AND SCREAMED UNTIL I WAS EXHAUSTED I THINK I KNEW WHEN I WAS NAUGHTY FOR I KNEW THAT IT HURT ELLA MY NURSE TO KICK HER
1092-134563-0012 BUT I CANNOT REMEMBER ANY INSTANCE IN WHICH THIS FEELING PREVENTED ME FROM REPEATING THE NAUGHTINESS WHEN I FAILED TO GET WHAT I WANTED
1092-134563-0013 MARTHA WASHINGTON THE CHILD OF OUR COOK AND BELLE AN OLD SETTER
1092-134563-0014 WERE MY CONSTANT COMPANIONS MARTHA WASHINGTON UNDERSTOOD MY SIGNS AND I SELDOM HAD ANY DIFFICULTY IN MAKING HER DO JUST AS I WISHED IT PLEASED ME TO DOMINEER OVER HER
1092-134563-0015 WE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME IN THE KITCHEN KNEADING DOUGH BALLS HELPING MAKE ICE CREAM GRINDING COFFEE QUARRELING OVER THE CAKE BOWL
1092-134563-0016 WE CARRIED OFF TO THE WOODPILE A CAKE WHICH THE COOK HAD JUST FROSTED AND ATE EVERY BIT OF IT I WAS QUITE ILL AFTERWARD AND I WONDER IF RETRIBUTION ALSO OVERTOOK THE TURKEY THE GUINEA FOWL LIKES TO HIDE HER NEST IN OUT OF THE WAY PLACES
1092-134563-0017 AND IT WAS ONE OF MY GREATEST DELIGHTS TO HUNT FOR THE EGGS IN THE LONG GRASS I COULD NOT TELL MARTHA WASHINGTON WHEN I WANTED TO GO EGG HUNTING BUT I WOULD DOUBLE MY HANDS AND PUT THEM ON THE GROUND WHICH MEANT SOMETHING ROUND IN THE GRASS
1092-134563-0018 THE MILKERS WOULD LET ME KEEP MY HANDS ON THE COWS WHILE THEY MILKED AND I OFTEN GOT WELL SWITCHED BY THE COW FOR MY CURIOSITY THE MAKING READY FOR CHRISTMAS WAS ALWAYS A DELIGHT TO ME OF COURSE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT
1092-134563-0019 BUT I ENJOYED THE PLEASANT ODOURS THAT FILLED THE HOUSE AND THE TIDBITS THAT WERE GIVEN TO MARTHA WASHINGTON AND ME TO KEEP US QUIET WE WERE SADLY IN THE WAY BUT THAT DID NOT INTERFERE WITH OUR PLEASURE IN THE LEAST THEY ALLOWED US TO GRIND THE SPICES
1092-134563-0020 I CANNOT REMEMBER HOWEVER THAT THE CEREMONY INTERESTED ME ESPECIALLY NOR DID MY CURIOSITY CAUSE ME TO WAKE BEFORE DAYLIGHT TO LOOK FOR MY GIFTS MARTHA WASHINGTON HAD AS GREAT A LOVE OF MISCHIEF AS I
1092-134563-0021 WITH LONG GOLDEN CURLS ONE CHILD WAS SIX YEARS OLD THE OTHER TWO OR THREE YEARS OLDER THE YOUNGER CHILD WAS BLIND THAT WAS I AND THE OTHER WAS MARTHA WASHINGTON
1092-134563-0022 I TURNED MY ATTENTION TO MARTHA'S CORKSCREWS SHE OBJECTED AT FIRST BUT FINALLY SUBMITTED THINKING THAT TURN AND TURN ABOUT IS FAIR PLAY SHE SEIZED THE SCISSORS AND CUT OFF ONE OF MY CURLS
1092-134563-0023 SHE SOMETIMES STARTED AND QUIVERED WITH EXCITEMENT THEN SHE BECAME PERFECTLY RIGID AS DOGS DO WHEN THEY POINT A BIRD I DID NOT THEN KNOW WHY BELLE ACTED IN THIS WAY BUT I KNEW SHE WAS NOT DOING AS I WISHED
1092-134563-0024 THIS VEXED ME AND THE LESSON ALWAYS ENDED IN A ONE SIDED BOXING MATCH BELLE WOULD GET UP
1092-134563-0025 GIVE ONE OR TWO CONTEMPTUOUS SNIFFS
1092-134563-0026 WENT OFF IN SEARCH OF MARTHA MANY INCIDENTS OF THOSE EARLY YEARS ARE FIXED IN MY MEMORY ISOLATED BUT CLEAR AND DISTINCT MAKING THE SENSE OF THAT SILENT AIMLESS DAYLESS LIFE ALL THE MORE INTENSE
1092-134563-0027 ONE DAY I HAPPENED TO SPILL WATER ON MY APRON AND I SPREAD IT OUT TO DRY BEFORE THE FIRE WHICH WAS FLICKERING ON THE SITTING ROOM HEARTH THE APRON DID NOT DRY QUICKLY ENOUGH TO SUIT ME SO I DREW NEARER AND THREW IT RIGHT OVER THE HOT ASHES
1092-134563-0028 VINY MY OLD NURSE TO THE RESCUE THROWING A BLANKET OVER ME SHE ALMOST SUFFOCATED ME BUT SHE PUT OUT THE FIRE EXCEPT FOR MY HANDS AND HAIR I WAS NOT BADLY BURNED ABOUT THIS TIME I FOUND OUT THE USE OF A KEY
1092-134563-0029 ONE MORNING I LOCKED MY MOTHER UP IN THE PANTRY WHERE SHE WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN THREE HOURS AS THE SERVANTS WERE IN A DETACHED PART OF THE HOUSE
1092-134563-0030 THIS MOST NAUGHTY PRANK OF MINE CONVINCED MY PARENTS THAT I MUST BE TAUGHT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER MY TEACHER MISS SULLIVAN CAME TO ME I SOUGHT AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY TO LOCK HER IN HER ROOM
1092-134563-0031 I WENT UPSTAIRS WITH SOMETHING WHICH MY MOTHER MADE ME UNDERSTAND I WAS TO GIVE TO MISS SULLIVAN BUT NO SOONER HAD I GIVEN IT TO HER
1092-134563-0032 I IMITATED THIS ACTION EVEN WEARING HIS SPECTACLES THINKING THEY MIGHT HELP SOLVE THE MYSTERY BUT I DID NOT FIND OUT THE SECRET FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEN I LEARNED WHAT THOSE PAPERS WERE AND THAT MY FATHER EDITED ONE OF THEM
1092-134563-0033 MY FATHER WAS MOST LOVING AND INDULGENT DEVOTED TO HIS HOME SELDOM LEAVING US EXCEPT IN THE HUNTING SEASON HE WAS A GREAT HUNTER I HAVE BEEN TOLD AND A CELEBRATED SHOT NEXT TO HIS FAMILY HE LOVED HIS DOGS AND GUN
1092-134563-0034 HIS HOSPITALITY WAS GREAT ALMOST TO A FAULT AND HE SELDOM CAME HOME
1092-134563-0035 HIS SPECIAL PRIDE WAS THE BIG GARDEN WHERE IT WAS SAID
1092-134563-0036 I REMEMBER HIS CARESSING TOUCH AS HE LED ME FROM TREE TO TREE FROM VINE TO VINE AND HIS EAGER DELIGHT IN WHATEVER PLEASED ME HE WAS A FAMOUS STORY TELLER AFTER I HAD ACQUIRED LANGUAGE
1092-134563-0037 HE USED TO SPELL CLUMSILY INTO MY HAND HIS CLEVEREST ANECDOTES AND NOTHING PLEASED HIM MORE THAN TO HAVE ME REPEAT THEM AT AN OPPORTUNE MOMENT I WAS IN THE NORTH
1092-134563-0038 WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS OF MY FATHER'S DEATH HE HAD HAD A SHORT ILLNESS
1092-134563-0039 THEN ALL WAS OVER THIS WAS MY FIRST GREAT SORROW MY FIRST PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH DEATH
1092-134563-0040 SHE IS SO NEAR TO ME THAT IT ALMOST SEEMS INDELICATE TO SPEAK OF HER FOR A LONG TIME I REGARDED MY LITTLE SISTER AS AN INTRUDER I KNEW THAT I HAD CEASED TO BE MY MOTHER'S ONLY DARLING AND THE THOUGHT FILLED ME WITH JEALOUSY
1092-134563-0041 SHE SAT IN MY MOTHER'S LAP CONSTANTLY WHERE I USED TO SIT AND SEEMED TO TAKE UP ALL HER CARE AND TIME ONE DAY SOMETHING HAPPENED WHICH SEEMED TO ME TO BE ADDING INSULT TO INJURY AT THAT TIME
1092-134563-0042 I HAD A MUCH PETTED MUCH ABUSED DOLL WHICH I AFTERWARD NAMED NANCY SHE WAS ALAS THE HELPLESS VICTIM OF MY OUTBURSTS OF TEMPER
1092-134563-0043 AT THIS PRESUMPTION ON THE PART OF ONE TO WHOM AS YET NO TIE OF LOVE BOUND ME I GREW ANGRY I RUSHED UPON THE CRADLE AND OVER TURNED IT AND THE BABY MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED HAD MY MOTHER NOT CAUGHT HER AS SHE FELL THUS
1092-134563-0044 WE KNOW LITTLE OF THE TENDER AFFECTIONS THAT GROW OUT OF ENDEARING WORDS AND ACTIONS AND COMPANIONSHIP BUT AFTERWARD WHEN I WAS RESTORED TO MY HUMAN HERITAGE
