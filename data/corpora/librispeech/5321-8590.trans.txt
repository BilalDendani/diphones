5321-8590-0000 AND AS THE CLOCK A STREET OR TWO AWAY HAD STRUCK SEVEN HE HAD STOOD HIS HANDS FOLDED ON HIS STICK FIRST CURIOUS THEN EXPECTANT
5321-8590-0001 ODDLY SATISFIED IN HIS MEMORY THE CLOCK HAD A PECULIAR CHIME A RATHER ELABORATE ONE ENDING INCONCLUSIVELY ON THE DOMINANT AND FOLLOWED AFTER AN UNUSUALLY LONG INTERVAL BY THE STROKE OF THE HOUR ITSELF
5321-8590-0002 NOT UNTIL ITS LAST VIBRATION HAD BECOME TOO SUBTLE FOR HIS EAR HAD ROMARIN RESUMED THE OCCUPATION THAT THE PEALING OF THE HOUR HAD INTERRUPTED IT WAS AN OCCUPATION THAT ESPECIALLY TENDED TO ABSTRACTION OF MIND
5321-8590-0003 THE NOTING IN DETAIL OF THE LITTLE THINGS OF THE STREET THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN WITH SUCH COMPLETENESS
5321-8590-0004 NOW THAT HIS EYES RESTED ON THEM AGAIN THE SHAPE OF A DOORKNOCKER THE GROUPING OF AN OLD CHIMNEY STACK THE CRACK STILL THERE IN A FLAGSTONE SOMEWHERE DEEP IN THE PAST THESE THINGS HAD ASSOCIATIONS
5321-8590-0005 BUT THEY LAY VERY DEEP AND THE DISTURBING OF THEM GAVE ROMARIN A CURIOUS DESOLATE FEELING AS OF RETURNING TO THINGS HE HAD LONG OUT GROWN BUT
5321-8590-0006 THE SLUGGISH MEMORIES ROUSED MORE AND MORE AND FOR EACH BIT OF THE OLD THAT REASSERTED ITSELF SCORES OF YARDS OF THE NEW SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR NEW SHOP FRONTAGES WENT A WALL
5321-8590-0007 BROUGHT UP FLUSH WHERE FORMERLY A RECESS HAD BEEN BECAME THE RECESS ONCE MORE THE INTERMITTENT ELECTRIC SIGN AT THE STREET'S END THAT WROTE IN GREEN AND CRIMSON THE NAME OF A WHISKEY ACROSS A LAMP LIT FACADE CEASED TO WORRY HIS EYES
5321-8590-0008 AND THE UNFAMILIAR NEW FRONT OF THE LITTLE RESTAURANT HE WAS PASSING AND REPASSING TOOK ON ITS OLD AND WELL KNOWN ASPECT AGAIN SEVEN O'CLOCK HE HAD THOUGHT IN DISMISSING HIS HANSOM
5321-8590-0009 THAT IT HAD BEEN LATER HIS APPOINTMENT WAS NOT UNTIL A QUARTER PAST
5321-8590-0010 SEEING WHO HIS GUEST WAS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT AT THE DOOR
5321-8590-0011 WHERE MEN WERE MOVING FLATS OF SCENERY FROM A BACK DOOR OF THE NEW THEATRE INTO A SORT OF TUMBRIL THE THEATRE WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD BUT TO ROMARIN IT WAS THE NEW THEATRE
5321-8590-0012 THERE HAD BEEN NO THEATRE THERE IN HIS DAY IN HIS DAY HIS DAY HAD BEEN TWICE TWENTY YEARS BEFORE
5321-8590-0013 HE HAD NOT FORTY YEARS AGO BEEN THE FAMOUS PAINTER HONOURED DECORATED TAKEN BY THE ARM BY MONARCHS
5321-8590-0014 WILD AND RAW AS ANY WITH THAT TRANQUIL AND URBANE PHILOSOPHY THAT HAD MADE HIS SUCCESS STILL IN ABEYANCE WITHIN HIM AS HIS EYES HAD RESTED ON THE DOORKNOCKER NEXT TO THE RESTAURANT A SMILE HAD CROSSED HIS FACE
5321-8590-0015 HOW HAD THAT DOOR KNOCKER COME TO BE LEFT BY THE OLD CROWD THAT HAD WRENCHED OFF SO MANY OTHERS BY WHAT ACCIDENT HAD THAT SURVIVED TO BRING BACK ALL THE OLD LIFE NOW SO ODDLY HE STOOD
5321-8590-0016 AGAIN SMILING HIS HANDS FOLDED ON HIS STICK
5321-8590-0017 AND HAD HAD IT ENGRAVED TO MY FRIEND ROMARIN YOU OUGHTN'T TO BE HERE YOU KNOW HE SAID TO THE DOOR KNOCKER IF I DIDN'T GET YOU MARSDEN OUGHT TO HAVE DONE SO
5321-8590-0018 IT WAS MARSDEN WHOM ROMARIN HAD COME TO MEET MARSDEN OF WHOM
5321-8590-0019 MARSDEN WAS THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD BETWEEN WHOM AND HIMSELF LAY AS MUCH AS THE SHADOW OF AN ENMITY AND EVEN THAT FAINT SHADOW WAS NOW PASSING ONE DOES NOT GUARD FOR FORTY YEARS
5321-8590-0020 ANIMOSITIES THAT TAKE THEIR RISE IN QUICK OUTBREAKS OF THE YOUNG BLOOD AND NOW THAT ROMARIN CAME TO THINK OF IT HE HADN'T REALLY HATED MARSDEN FOR MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS IT HAD BEEN WITHIN THOSE VERY DOORS
5321-8590-0021 ROMARIN WAS PASSING THE RESTAURANT AGAIN THAT THERE HAD BEEN THAT QUICK BLOW ABOUT A GIRL
5321-8590-0022 AND ROMARIN WAS NOW SIXTY FOUR AND MARSDEN MUST BE A YEAR OLDER AND THE GIRL WHO KNEW PROBABLY DEAD LONG AGO YES TIME HEALS THESE THINGS THANK GOD
5321-8590-0023 AND ROMARIN HAD FELT A GENUINE FLUSH OF PLEASURE WHEN MARSDEN HAD ACCEPTED HIS INVITATION TO DINNER BUT ROMARIN LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AGAIN IT WAS RATHER LIKE MARSDEN TO BE LATE
5321-8590-0024 REGARDLESS OF INCONVENIENCE TO OTHERS BUT DOUBTLESS HE HAD HAD TO WALK IF ALL REPORTS WERE TRUE MARSDEN
5321-8590-0025 IN THE WAY OF WORLDLY SUCCESS AND ROMARIN SORRY TO HEAR IT HAD WISHED HE COULD GIVE HIM A LEG UP
5321-8590-0026 AND ROMARIN HONOURED AND SUCCESSFUL YET KNEW THAT HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE MARSDEN TO BE LATE FOR ALL THAT AT FIRST
5321-8590-0027 ROMARIN DID NOT RECOGNISE HIM WHEN HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND WALKED TOWARDS HIM HE HADN'T MADE UP HIS MIND BEFOREHAND EXACTLY HOW HE HAD EXPECTED MARSDEN TO LOOK
5321-8590-0028 WAS NOT THE SHORT STUBBLE OF GREY BEARD
5321-8590-0029 IT WAS NOT THE FIGURE NOR CARRIAGE CLOTHES ALTER THAT AND THE CLOTHES OF THE MAN WHO WAS ADVANCING TO MEET ROMARIN WERE TO PUT IT BLUNTLY SHABBY NOR WAS IT BUT ROMARIN DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS IN THE ADVANCING FIGURE THAT
5321-8590-0030 HE WAS ALREADY WITHIN HALF A DOZEN YARDS OF THE MEN WHO WERE MOVING THE SCENERY FROM THE THEATRE INTO THE TUMBRIL AND ONE OF THE WORKMEN PUT UP HIS HAND AS THE EDGE OF A FRESH WING APPEARED
5321-8590-0031 BUT AT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE THE SAME THING HAPPENED THAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK SEVEN ROMARIN FOUND HIMSELF SUDDENLY EXPECTANT ATTENTIVE AND THEN AGAIN CURIOUSLY SATISFIED IN HIS MEMORY
5321-8590-0032 MARSDEN'S VOICE AT LEAST HAD NOT CHANGED IT WAS AS IN THE OLD DAYS A LITTLE ENVIOUS SARCASTIC ACCEPTING LOWER INTERPRETATIONS SOMEWHAT WILLINGLY SOMEWHAT GRUDGING OF BETTER ONES
5321-8590-0033 THE GROUPING OF THE CHIMNEY STACK AND THE CRACK IN THE FLAGSTONE HAD BEGUN
5321-8590-0034 MY MARSDEN'S VOICE SOUNDED ACROSS THE GROUP OF SCENE SHIFTERS A MO IF YOU PLEASE GUV'NOR SAID ANOTHER VOICE FOR A MOMENT THE PAINTED WING SHUT THEM OFF FROM ONE ANOTHER
5321-8590-0035 IN THAT MOMENT ROMARIN'S ACCIDENT BEFELL HIM
5321-8590-0036 THERE ARE NO OTHER TERMS TO RELATE IT IN IT IS A DECODED CIPHER WHICH CAN BE RESTORED TO ITS CRYPTIC FORM AS ROMARIN SUBSEQUENTLY RESTORED IT AS THE PAINTER TOOK MARSDEN'S ARM AND ENTERED THE RESTAURANT HE NOTICED
5321-8590-0037 ITS INSIDE WAS ENTIRELY NEW ITS CHEAP GLITTERING WALL MIRRORS THAT GAVE A FALSE IMPRESSION OF THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PLACE ITS LOVES AND SHEPHERDESSES PAINTED IN THE STYLE OF THE CARTS OF THE VENDORS OF ICE CREAM
5321-8590-0038 MIGHT ALL HAVE BEEN MATCHED IN A DOZEN SIMILAR ESTABLISHMENTS WITHIN HAIL OF A CAB WHISTLE ITS GELATINE WRITTEN MENU CARDS ANNOUNCED THAT ONE MIGHT DINE THERE A LA CARTE OR
5321-8590-0039 HE MADE A GESTURE TO THE WAITER WHO ADVANCED TO HELP HIM ON WITH HIS COAT THAT MARSDEN WAS TO BE ASSISTED FIRST BUT MARSDEN WITH A GRUNTED ALL RIGHT HAD ALREADY HELPED HIMSELF A GLIMPSE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE COAT TOLD ROMARIN
5321-8590-0040 WHY MARSDEN KEPT WAITERS AT ARM'S LENGTH A LITTLE TWINGE OF COMPUNCTION
5321-8590-0041 THEY SAT DOWN AT A CORNER TABLE NOT FAR FROM THE SLOWLY MOVING FOUR BLADED PROPELLER NOW WE CAN TALK ROMARIN SAID I'M GLAD GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MARSDEN
5321-8590-0042 IT WAS A PECULIARLY VICIOUS FACE THAT HE SAW CORRUGATED ABOUT THE BROWS AND WITH STIFF IRON GREY HAIR UNTRIMMED ABOUT THE EARS
5321-8590-0043 ACCENTUATED BY THE PASSAGE OF TIME ROMARIN'S OWN BROW WAS HIGH AND BALD AND BENIGN AND HIS BEARD WAS LIKE A BROAD SHIELD OF SILVER YOU'RE GLAD ARE YOU SAID MARSDEN
5321-8590-0044 AS THEY SAT DOWN FACING ONE ANOTHER WELL I'M GLAD TO BE SEEN WITH YOU IT'LL REVIVE MY CREDIT A BIT THERE'S A FELLOW ACROSS THERE HAS RECOGNISED YOU ALREADY BY YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE PAPERS I ASSUME I MAY
5321-8590-0045 HE MADE A LITTLE UPWARD MOVEMENT OF HIS HAND IT WAS A GIN AND BITTERS MARSDEN ASSUMED HE MIGHT HAVE ROMARIN ORDERED IT HE HIMSELF DID NOT TAKE ONE MARSDEN TOSSED DOWN THE APERITIF AT ONE GULP
5321-8590-0046 THEN HE REACHED FOR HIS ROLL PULLED IT TO PIECES AND ROMARIN REMEMBERED HOW IN THE OLD DAYS MARSDEN HAD ALWAYS EATEN BREAD LIKE THAT BEGAN TO THROW BULLETS OF BREAD INTO HIS MOUTH
5321-8590-0047 FORMERLY THIS HABIT HAD IRRITATED ROMARIN INTENSELY NOW WELL WELL LIFE USES SOME OF US BETTER THAN OTHERS SMALL BLAME TO THESE IF THEY THROW UP THE STRUGGLE MARSDEN POOR DEVIL
5321-8590-0048 LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY ACROSS THE GLASS WITH THE DREGS OF THE GIN AND BITTERS
5321-8590-0049 EH HE SAID I SAY ROMARIN DON'T LET'S GO GRAVE DIGGING AMONG MEMORIES MERELY FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING CONVERSATION
5321-8590-0050 BUT I'M NOT IN THE HABIT OF WASTING MUCH TIME OVER MINE MIGHT AS WELL BE MAKING NEW ONES I'LL DRINK WHISKEY AND SODA IT WAS BROUGHT A LARGE ONE AND MARSDEN NODDING TOOK A DEEP GULP HEALTH
5321-8590-0051 HE SAID THANKS SAID ROMARIN INSTANTLY NOTING THAT THE MONOSYLLABLE WHICH MATCHED THE OTHER'S IN CURTNESS WAS NOT AT ALL THE REPLY HE HAD INTENDED THANK YOU YOURS HE AMENDED
5321-8590-0052 AND A SHORT PAUSE FOLLOWED IN WHICH FISH WAS BROUGHT THIS WAS NOT WHAT ROMARIN HAD HOPED FOR
5321-8590-0053 YET IF MARSDEN DID NOT WISH TO TALK IT WAS DIFFICULT NOT TO DEFER TO HIS WISH
5321-8590-0054 BUT MARSDEN'S PROMPT POINTING OUT OF THIS WAS NOT ENCOURAGING NOW THAT HE CAME TO THINK OF IT
5321-8590-0055 HE ONLY KNEW THAT THIS CREED OF ROMANTICISM WHATEVER IT WAS HAD BEEN WORN RATHER CHALLENGINGLY A CHIP ON THE SHOULDER TO BE KNOCKED OFF AT SOME PERIL OR OTHER
5321-8590-0056 THE POINT WAS THAT THE CONVERSATION HAD BEGUN NOT VERY HAPPILY AND MUST BE MENDED AT ONCE IF AT ALL TO MEND IT ROMARIN LEANED ACROSS THE TABLE BE AS FRIENDLY AS I AM MARSDEN HE SAID I THINK
5321-8590-0057 PARDON ME THAT IF OUR POSITIONS WERE REVERSED AND I SAW IN YOU THE SINCERE DESIRE TO HELP THAT I HAVE I'D TAKE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY AGAIN MARSDEN LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY AT HIM TO HELP
5321-8590-0058 HOW TO HELP HE DEMANDED THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME BUT I SUPPOSE FOR EXAMPLE YOU STILL WORK OH MY WORK
5321-8590-0059 TRY AGAIN ROMARIN YOU DON'T DO ANY COME I'M NO BAD FRIEND TO MY FRIENDS AND YOU'LL FIND ME ESPECIALLY SO BUT MARSDEN PUT UP HIS HAND NOT QUITE SO QUICKLY
5321-8590-0060 HE SAID LET'S SEE WHAT YOU MEAN BY HELP FIRST DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT YOU WANT ME TO BORROW MONEY FROM YOU THAT'S HELP AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOWADAYS THEN YOU'VE CHANGED SAID ROMARIN WONDERING
5321-8590-0061 HOWEVER IN HIS SECRET HEART WHETHER MARSDEN HAD CHANGED VERY MUCH IN THAT RESPECT AFTER ALL MARSDEN GAVE A SHORT HONK OF A LAUGH YOU DIDN'T SUPPOSE I HADN'T CHANGED DID YOU THEN HE LEANED SUDDENLY FORWARD
5321-8590-0062 THIS IS RATHER A MISTAKE ROMARIN RATHER A MISTAKE HE SAID WHAT IS
5321-8590-0063 ROMARIN SIGHED I HAD HOPED NOT HE SAID MARSDEN LEANED FORWARD AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GESTURE ROMARIN REMEMBERED VERY WELL DINNER KNIFE IN HAND
5321-8590-0064 EDGE AND PALM UPWARDS PUNCTUATING AND EXPOUNDING WITH THE POINT I TELL YOU IT'S A MISTAKE HE SAID KNIFE AND HAND BALANCED YOU CAN'T REOPEN THINGS LIKE THIS YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO REOPEN THEM YOU ONLY WANT TO REOPEN CERTAIN OF THEM
5321-8590-0065 TO APPROVE AND DISAPPROVE
5321-8590-0066 YOU DIDN'T ALTOGETHER DISLIKE I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME THINK WHAT IT WAS BY THE WAY AND YOU WANT TO LAY STRESS ON THAT AND TO SINK THE REST WELL YOU CAN'T I WON'T LET YOU I'LL NOT SUBMIT MY LIFE TO YOU LIKE THAT
5321-8590-0067 AND I'D LIKE ANOTHER DRINK HE PUT THE KNIFE DOWN WITH A LITTLE CLAP AS ROMARIN BECKONED TO THE WAITER THERE WAS DISTRESS ON ROMARIN'S FACE HE WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF HAVING ADOPTED A SUPERIOR ATTITUDE
5321-8590-0068 BUT AGAIN HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE MUST MAKE ALLOWANCES MEN WHO DON'T COME OFF IN LIFE'S STRUGGLE ARE APT TO BE TOUCHY AND HE WAS AFTER ALL THE SAME OLD MARSDEN THE MAN WITH WHOM
5321-8590-0069 HE DESIRED TO BE AT PEACE ARE YOU QUITE FAIR TO ME HE ASKED PRESENTLY IN A LOW VOICE
5321-8590-0070 AND HE INDICATED WITH THE KNIFE THE MIRROR AT THE END OF THE TABLE YOU KNOW YOU'VE DONE WELL AND I TO ALL APPEARANCES HAVEN'T YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THAT GLASS AND NOT KNOW IT BUT I'VE FOLLOWED THE LINE OF MY DEVELOPMENT TOO NO LESS LOGICALLY THAN YOU
5321-8590-0071 MORE I'M PROUD OF IT AT LEAST THERE'S BEEN SINGLENESS OF INTENTION ABOUT IT SO I THINK I'M STRICTLY FAIR IN POINTING THAT OUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HELPING ME PERHAPS SO PERHAPS SO
5321-8590-0072 ROMARIN AGREED A LITTLE SADLY IT'S YOUR TONE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT MAKES THINGS A LITTLE DIFFICULT BELIEVE ME I'VE NO END IN MY MIND EXCEPT PURE FRIENDLINESS
5321-8590-0073 SAID MARSDEN A LONG NO THAT SEEMED TO DELIBERATE TO EXAMINE AND FINALLY TO ADMIT
5321-8590-0074 I BELIEVE THAT AND YOU USUALLY GET WHAT YOU SET OUT FOR OH YES I'VE WATCHED YOUR RISE I'VE MADE A POINT OF WATCHING IT IT'S BEEN A BIT AT A TIME BUT YOU'VE GOT THERE YOU'RE THAT SORT IT'S
5321-8590-0075 ON YOUR FOREHEAD YOUR DESTINY ROMARIN SMILED HALLO THAT'S NEW ISN'T IT HE SAID IT WASN'T YOUR HABIT TO TALK MUCH ABOUT DESTINY IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY
5321-8590-0076 WITH ALWAYS THE SUSPICION NOT FAR AWAY THAT YOU DID THINGS MORE FROM THEORETICAL CONVICTION THAN REAL IMPULSE AFTER ALL
5321-8590-0077 WENT SOMEWHERE NEAR HOME MARSDEN WAS SCRAPING TOGETHER WITH THE EDGE OF HIS KNIFE THE CRUMBS OF HIS BROKEN ROLL HE SCRAPED THEM INTO A LITTLE SQUARE AND THEN TRIMMED THE CORNERS
5321-8590-0078 DID HE LOOK SURLILY UP LET IT REST ROMARIN
5321-8590-0079 IF I BEGIN TO TALK LIKE THAT TOO WE SHALL ONLY CUT ONE ANOTHER UP CLINK GLASSES THERE AND LET IT ALONE MECHANICALLY ROMARIN CLINKED BUT HIS BALD BROW WAS PERPLEXED CUT ONE ANOTHER UP
