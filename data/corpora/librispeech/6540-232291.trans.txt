6540-232291-0001 LUNCHEON AWAITED THEM BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER TO ARRIVE AT AN UNDERSTANDING BEFORE THEY SAT DOWN TO THE MEAL SHE ENTERED THE ROOM AND FOUND LOUISE LEANING ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR I DARE SAY YOU HEARD THE ROW MISS DERRICK REMARKED COLDLY I'M VERY SORRY
6540-232291-0002 BUT NOTHING OF THAT KIND SHALL HAPPEN AGAIN HER COUNTENANCE WAS DISTURBED SHE SEEMED TO BE PUTTING A RESTRAINT UPON HERSELF AND ONLY WITH GREAT EFFORT TO SUBDUE HER VOICE
6540-232291-0003 IN A FRIENDLY TONE BUT AS IT WERE FROM A DISTANCE I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO ME A GREAT KINDNESS MISSUS MUMFORD THERE WAS NO REPLY THE GIRL PAUSED A MOMENT THEN RESUMED IMPULSIVELY
6540-232291-0004 MISTER HIGGINS SAYS THAT IF I DON'T COME HOME HE WON'T LET ME HAVE ANY MORE MONEY THEY'RE GOING TO WRITE AND TELL YOU THAT THEY WON'T BE RESPONSIBLE AFTER THIS FOR MY BOARD AND LODGING OF COURSE I SHALL NOT GO HOME I SHOULDN'T DREAM OF IT I'D RATHER EARN MY LIVING AS

6540-232291-0006 SHE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN HER PURPOSE IT SHAMED HER TO BEHAVE LIKE THE ORDINARY LANDLADY TO APPEAR ACTUATED BY MEAN MOTIVES BUT THE DOMESTIC STRAIN WAS GROWING INTOLERABLE
6540-232291-0007 AND SHE FELT SURE THAT CLARENCE WOULD BE EXASPERATED IF HER WEAKNESS PROLONGED IT NOW DO LET ME ADVISE YOU LOUISE SHE ANSWERED GENTLY ARE YOU ACTING WISELY WOULDN'T IT BE VERY MUCH BETTER TO GO HOME LOUISE LOST ALL HER SELF CONTROL
6540-232291-0008 FLUSHED WITH ANGER HER EYES GLARING SHE BROKE INTO VEHEMENT EXCLAMATIONS YOU WANT TO GET RID OF ME VERY WELL I'LL GO THIS MOMENT I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
6540-232291-0009 I'LL SEND FOR MY LUGGAGE YOU SHAN'T BE TROUBLED WITH IT LONG
6540-232291-0010 I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE ONE OF THAT KIND I'LL GO THIS MINUTE JUST AS YOU PLEASE SAID EMMELINE YOUR TEMPER IS REALLY SO VERY OH I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS MY TEMPER AND NOBODY ELSE IS EVER TO BLAME
6540-232291-0011 SHE FLUNG OUT OF THE ROOM AND FLEW UPSTAIRS EMMELINE ANGERED BY THIS UNWARRANTABLE TREATMENT DETERMINED TO HOLD ALOOF AND LET THE GIRL DO AS SHE WOULD
6540-232291-0012 AND QUITE CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF HERSELF OR AT ALL EVENTS OUGHT TO BE PERHAPS THIS WAS THE ONLY POSSIBLE ISSUE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN WHICH THEY HAD ALL BECOME INVOLVED NEITHER LOUISE NOR HER PARENTS COULD BE DEALT WITH IN THE RATIONAL PEACEFUL WAY PREFERRED BY WELL CONDITIONED PEOPLE
6540-232291-0013 TO GET HER OUT OF THE HOUSE WAS THE MAIN POINT IF SHE CHOSE TO DEPART IN A WHIRLWIND THAT WAS HER OWN AFFAIR ALL BUT CERTAINLY SHE WOULD GO HOME TO MORROW IF NOT TO DAY IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HER STEP SOUNDED ON THE STAIRS
6540-232291-0014 WOULD SHE TURN INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE EMMELINE NOW SAT AT TABLE NO STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HALL AND OUT AT THE FRONT DOOR WHICH CLOSED HOWEVER QUITE SOFTLY BEHIND HER THAT SHE DID NOT SLAM IT SEEMED WONDERFUL TO EMMELINE
6540-232291-0015 THE GIRL WAS NOT WHOLLY A SAVAGE PRESENTLY MISSUS MUMFORD WENT UP TO INSPECT THE FORSAKEN CHAMBER LOUISE HAD PACKED ALL HER THINGS
6540-232291-0016 DRAWERS WERE LEFT OPEN AS IF TO EXHIBIT THEIR EMPTINESS BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS THE ROOM LOOKED TIDY ENOUGH NEATNESS AND ORDER CAME BY NO MEANS NATURALLY TO MISS DERRICK AND EMMELINE DID NOT KNOW WHAT PAINS THE GIRL HAD TAKEN EVER SINCE HER ARRIVAL
6540-232291-0017 TO LIVE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE HABITS OF A NICE HOUSEHOLD LOUISE MEANWHILE HAD GONE TO THE RAILWAY STATION INTENDING TO TAKE A TICKET FOR VICTORIA BUT HALF AN HOUR MUST ELAPSE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF A TRAIN
6540-232291-0018 AND SHE WALKED ABOUT IN AN IRRESOLUTE MOOD FOR ONE THING SHE FELT HUNGRY AT SUTTON HER APPETITE HAD BEEN KEEN AND MEAL TIMES WERE ALWAYS WELCOME SHE ENTERED THE REFRESHMENT ROOM
6540-232291-0019 AND WITH INWARD MURMURS MADE A REPAST WHICH REMINDED HER OF THE EXCELLENT LUNCHEON SHE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN ENJOYING ALL THE TIME SHE PONDERED HER SITUATION ULTIMATELY INSTEAD OF BOOKING FOR VICTORIA SHE PROCURED A TICKET FOR EPSOM DOWNS
6540-232291-0020 AND HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR THE TRAIN IT WAS A HOT DAY AT THE END OF JUNE WAFTS OF BREEZY COOLNESS PASSED NOW AND THEN OVER THE HIGH OPEN COUNTRY BUT DID NOT SUFFICE TO COMBAT THE SUN'S STEADY GLARE AFTER WALKING HALF A MILE OR SO ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
6540-232291-0021 LOUISE SUFFERED SO MUCH THAT SHE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SHADOW BEFORE HER WAS THE TOWERING UGLINESS OF THE GRAND STAND THIS SHE HAD SEEN AND ADMIRED WHEN DRIVING PAST IT WITH HER FRIENDS IT DID NOT NOW ATTRACT HER
6540-232291-0022 IN ANOTHER DIRECTION THE DOWNS WERE EDGED WITH TREES AND THAT WAY SHE TURNED ALL BUT OVERCOME WITH HEAT AND WEARINESS SHE AT LENGTH FOUND A SHADED SPOT WHERE HER SOLITUDE SEEMED SECURE AND AFTER SEATING HERSELF
6540-232291-0023 THE FIRST THING SHE DID WAS TO HAVE A GOOD CRY THEN FOR AN HOUR SHE SAT THINKING AND AS SHE THOUGHT HER FACE GRADUALLY EMERGED FROM GLOOM THE BETTER TRUER FACE WHICH SO OFTEN ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE DISGUISED AT THE PROMPTING OF AN EVIL SPIRIT
6540-232291-0024 HER SOFTENING LIPS ALL BUT SMILED AS IF AT AN AMUSING SUGGESTION AND HER EYES IN THEIR REVERIE SEEMED TO BEHOLD A PLEASANT PROMISE UNCONSCIOUSLY SHE PLUCKED AND TASTED THE SWEET STEMS OF GRASS THAT GREW ABOUT HER AT LENGTH
6540-232291-0025 THE SUN'S MOVEMENTS HAVING ROBBED HER OF SHADOW SHE ROSE LOOKED AT HER WATCH AND GLANCED AROUND FOR ANOTHER RETREAT HARD BY WAS A LITTLE WOOD DELIGHTFULLY GRASSY AND COOL FENCED ABOUT WITH RAILINGS SHE COULD EASILY HAVE CLIMBED
6540-232291-0026 BUT A NOTICE BOARD SEVERELY ADMONISHING TRESPASSERS FORBADE THE ATTEMPT WITH A PETULANT REMARK TO HERSELF ON THE SELFISHNESS OF THOSE PEOPLE SHE SAUNTERED PAST ALONG THIS EDGE OF THE DOWNS STANDS A PICTURESQUE ROW OF PINE TREES
6540-232291-0027 STUNTED BITTERED AND TWISTED THROUGH MANY A WINTER BY THE UPLAND GALES LOUISE NOTICED THEM ONLY TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT UGLY TREES THEY WERE BEFORE HER EAST WEST AND NORTH LAY THE WOODED LANDSCAPE
6540-232291-0028 SOFT OF HUE BENEATH THE SUMMER SKY SPREADING ITS TRANQUIL BEAUTY FAR AWAY TO THE MISTS OF THE HORIZON IN VIVACIOUS COMPANY SHE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT AND PERHAPS HAVE THOUGHT IT A CHARMING VIEW ALONE SHE HAD NO EYE FOR SUCH THINGS
6540-232291-0029 AN INDIFFERENCE CHARACTERISTIC OF HER MIND AND NOT AT ALL DEPENDENT UPON ITS MOOD PRESENTLY ANOTHER PATCH OF SHADE INVITED HER TO REPOSE AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE MEDITATED FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THE SUN HAD GROWN LESS ARDENT
6540-232291-0030 AND A BREEZE NO LONGER FITFUL MADE WALKING PLEASANT THE SIGHT OF HOLIDAY MAKING SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO IN THEIR RIBBONED HATS AND WHITE PINAFORES WERE HAVING TEA NOT FAR AWAY SUGGESTED TO LOUISE THAT SHE ALSO WOULD LIKE SUCH REFRESHMENT
6540-232291-0031 DOUBTLESS IT MIGHT BE PROCURED AT THE INN YONDER NEAR THE RACECOURSE AND THITHER SHE BEGAN TO MOVE HER THOUGHTS WERE MORE AT REST SHE HAD MADE HER PLAN FOR THE EVENING ALL THAT HAD TO BE DONE WAS TO KILL TIME FOR ANOTHER HOUR OR SO
6540-232291-0032 WALKING LIGHTLY OVER THE TURF SHE NOTICED THE CHALK MARKS SIGNIFICANT OF GOLF AND WONDERED HOW THE GAME WAS PLAYED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY SHE OBTAINED HER CUP OF TEA LOITERED OVER IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE STRAYED YET AWHILE ABOUT THE DOWNS
6540-232291-0033 AND TOWARDS HALF PAST SIX MADE FOR THE RAILWAY STATION SHE TRAVELLED NO FURTHER THAN SUTTON AND THERE LINGERED IN THE WAITING ROOM TILL THE ARRIVAL OF A CERTAIN TRAIN FROM LONDON BRIDGE AS THE TRAIN CAME IN SHE TOOK UP A POSITION NEAR THE EXIT
6540-232291-0034 AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO HAD ALIGHTED HER EYE SOON PERCEIVED CLARENCE MUMFORD SHE STEPPED UP TO HIM AND DREW HIS ATTENTION OH HAVE YOU COME BY THE SAME TRAIN HE ASKED SHAKING HANDS WITH HER NO
6540-232291-0035 I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE YOU MISTER MUMFORD WILL YOU SPARE ME A MINUTE OR TWO HERE IN THE STATION PLEASE IF YOU DON'T MIND ASTONISHED MUMFORD DREW ASIDE WITH HER TO A QUIET PART OF THE LONG PLATFORM
6540-232291-0036 LOUISE KEEPING A VERY GRAVE COUNTENANCE TOLD HIM RAPIDLY ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN SINCE HIS DEPARTURE FROM HOME IN THE MORNING I BEHAVED HORRIDLY
6540-232291-0037 AFTER ALL MISSUS MUMFORD'S KINDNESS TO ME AND YOURS I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD BE SO HORRID
6540-232291-0038 AND I FELT SO MISERABLE WHEN MISSUS MUMFORD SEEMED TO WANT TO GET RID OF ME I FEEL SURE SHE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO SEND ME AWAY SHE WAS ONLY ADVISING ME AS SHE THOUGHT FOR MY GOOD BUT I CAN'T AND WON'T GO HOME
6540-232291-0039 AND I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL THE AFTERNOON TO SEE YOU NO NOT HERE
6540-232291-0040 AND THEN CAME BACK JUST IN TIME AND DO YOU THINK I MIGHT GO BACK I DON'T MEAN NOW AT ONCE BUT THIS EVENING AFTER YOU'VE HAD DINNER I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO FOR THE NIGHT AND IT'S SUCH A STUPID POSITION TO BE IN ISN'T IT
6540-232291-0041 WITH PERFECT NAIVETE OR WITH PERFECT SIMULATION OF IT SHE LOOKED HIM IN THE FACE AND IT WAS MUMFORD WHO HAD TO AVERT HIS EYES THE YOUNG MAN FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
6540-232291-0042 OH I'M QUITE SURE EMMY WILL BE GLAD TO LET YOU COME FOR THE NIGHT MISS DERRICK YES BUT MISTER MUMFORD I WANT TO STAY LONGER A FEW WEEKS LONGER DO YOU THINK MISSUS MUMFORD WOULD FORGIVE ME I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND WHAT TO DO
6540-232291-0043 AND I OUGHT TO HAVE TOLD HER I SHOULD HAVE IF I HADN'T LOST MY TEMPER WELL REPLIED THE OTHER IN GRAVE EMBARRASSMENT BUT FEELING THAT HE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE LET US GO TO THE HOUSE OH I COULDN'T
6540-232291-0044 IT WOULDN'T BE NICE WOULD IT I THOUGHT IF I CAME LATER AFTER DINNER AND PERHAPS YOU COULD TALK TO MISSUS MUMFORD AND AND PREPARE HER I MEAN
6540-232291-0045 AND THEN PERHAPS MISSUS MUMFORD SHE'S SO KIND WOULD SAY THAT SHE WAS SORRY TOO AND THEN I MIGHT COME INTO THE GARDEN AND FIND YOU BOTH SITTING THERE MUMFORD DESPITE HIS MOST UNEASY FRAME OF MIND BETRAYED A PASSING AMUSEMENT
6540-232291-0046 HE LOOKED INTO THE GIRL'S FACE AND SAW ITS PRETTINESS FLUSH WITH PRETTY CONFUSION AND THIS DID NOT TEND TO RESTORE HIS TRANQUILLITY WHAT SHALL YOU DO IN THE MEANTIME
6540-232291-0047 AND THEN WALK ABOUT YOU MUST BE DREADFULLY TIRED ALREADY JUST A LITTLE BUT I DON'T MIND IT SERVES ME RIGHT I SHALL BE SO GRATEFUL TO YOU MISTER MUMFORD
6540-232291-0048 I WILL ARRANGE IT COME ABOUT HALF PAST EIGHT WE SHALL BE IN THE GARDEN BY THEN AVOIDING HER LOOK HE MOVED AWAY AND RAN UP THE STAIRS BUT FROM THE EXIT OF THE STATION HE WALKED SLOWLY IN PART TO CALM HIMSELF
6540-232291-0049 AND IN PART TO THINK OVER THE COMEDY HE WAS GOING TO PLAY EMMELINE MET HIM AT THE DOOR HERSELF TOO MUCH FLURRIED TO NOTICE ANYTHING PECULIAR IN HER HUSBAND'S ASPECT SHE REPEATED THE STORY WITH WHICH HE WAS ALREADY ACQUAINTED
6540-232291-0050 AND REALLY AFTER ALL I AM SO GLAD WAS HER CONCLUSION I DIDN'T THINK SHE HAD REALLY GONE ALL THE AFTERNOON I'VE BEEN EXPECTING TO SEE HER BACK AGAIN BUT SHE WON'T COME NOW AND IT IS A GOOD THING TO HAVE DONE WITH THE WRETCHED BUSINESS
6540-232291-0051 I ONLY HOPE SHE WILL TELL THE TRUTH TO HER PEOPLE SHE MIGHT SAY THAT WE TURNED HER OUT OF THE HOUSE BUT I DON'T THINK SO IN SPITE OF ALL HER FAULTS SHE NEVER SEEMED DECEITFUL OR MALICIOUS MUMFORD WAS STRONGLY TEMPTED TO REVEAL WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE STATION
6540-232291-0052 BUT HE SAW DANGER ALIKE IN DISCLOSURE AND IN RETICENCE WHEN THERE ENTERS THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBILITY OF JEALOUSY A MAN CAN NEVER BE SURE THAT HIS WIFE WILL ACT AS A RATIONAL BEING
6540-232291-0053 HE FEARED TO TELL THE SIMPLE TRUTH LEST EMMELINE SHOULD NOT BELIEVE HIS INNOCENCE OF PREVIOUS PLOTTING WITH MISS DERRICK OR AT ALL EVENTS SHOULD BE IRRITATED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO REFUSING LOUISE A LODGING FOR THE NIGHT
6540-232291-0054 AND WITH NO LESS APPREHENSION HE DECIDED AT LENGTH TO KEEP THE SECRET WHICH MIGHT SO EASILY BECOME KNOWN HEREAFTER AND WOULD THEN HAVE SUCH DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCES WELL LET US HAVE DINNER EMMY I'M HUNGRY
6540-232291-0055 YES IT'S A GOOD THING SHE HAS GONE BUT I WISH IT HADN'T HAPPENED IN THAT WAY WHAT A SPITFIRE SHE IS I NEVER NEVER SAW THE LIKE AND IF YOU HAD HEARD MISSUS HIGGINS OH WHAT DREADFUL PEOPLE
6540-232291-0056 IT WAS MY FAULT DEAR
6540-232291-0057 IT WAS WHOLLY AND ENTIRELY MY FAULT BY DUE INSISTENCE ON THIS MUMFORD OF COURSE PUT HIS WIFE INTO AN EXCELLENT HUMOUR AND AFTER THEY HAD DINED SHE RETURNED TO HER REGRET THAT THE GIRL SHOULD HAVE GONE SO SUDDENLY
6540-232291-0058 CLARENCE DECLARING THAT HE WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF A CIGAR INSTEAD OF THE USUAL PIPE TO CELEBRATE THE RESTORATION OF DOMESTIC PEACE SOON LED EMMELINE INTO THE GARDEN HEAVENS HOW HOT IT HAS BEEN
6540-232291-0059 EIGHTY FIVE IN OUR OFFICE AT NOON EIGHTY FIVE FELLOWS ARE DISCARDING WAISTCOATS AND WEARING WHAT THEY CALL A CUMMERBUND SILK SASH ROUND THE WAIST I THINK I MUST FOLLOW THE FASHION HOW SHOULD I LOOK DO YOU THINK
6540-232291-0060 YOU DON'T REALLY MIND THAT WE LOSE THE MONEY EMMELINE ASKED PRESENTLY POOH WE SHALL DO WELL ENOUGH WHO'S THAT SOMEONE WAS ENTERING THE GARDEN BY THE SIDE PATH AND IN A MOMENT THERE REMAINED NO DOUBT WHO THE PERSON WAS
6540-232291-0061 LOUISE CAME FORWARD HER HEAD BENT HER FEATURES ELOQUENT OF FATIGUE AND DISTRESS MISSUS MUMFORD I COULDN'T WITHOUT ASKING YOU TO FORGIVE ME HER VOICE BROKE WITH A SOB SHE STOOD IN A HUMBLE ATTITUDE AND EMMELINE
6540-232291-0062 THOUGH PIERCED WITH VEXATION HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO HOLD OUT A WELCOMING HAND HAVE YOU COME ALL THE WAY BACK FROM LONDON JUST TO SAY THIS I HAVEN'T BEEN TO LONDON I'VE WALKED ABOUT ALL DAY AND OH I'M SO TIRED AND MISERABLE
6540-232291-0063 WILL YOU LET ME STAY JUST FOR TO NIGHT I SHALL BE SO GRATEFUL OF COURSE YOU MAY STAY MISS DERRICK IT WAS VERY FAR FROM MY WISH TO SEE YOU GO OFF AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE BUT I REALLY COULDN'T STOP YOU MUMFORD HAD STEPPED ASIDE OUT OF HEARING
6540-232291-0064 HE FORGOT HIS PRIVATE EMBARRASSMENT IN SPECULATION AS TO THE YOUNG WOMAN'S CHARACTER THAT SHE WAS ACTING DISTRESS AND PENITENCE HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE INDEED THERE WAS NO NECESSITY TO ACCUSE HER OF DISHONEST BEHAVIOUR
6540-232291-0065 THE TRIVIAL CONCEALMENT BETWEEN HIM AND HER AMOUNTED TO NOTHING DID NOT ALTER THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION BUT WHAT COULD BE AT THE ROOT OF HER SEEMINGLY SO FOOLISH EXISTENCE EMMELINE HELD TO THE VIEW THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE MAN COBB
6540-232291-0066 THOUGH PERHAPS UNWILLING TO ADMIT IT EVEN IN HER OWN SILLY MIND IT MIGHT BE SO AND IF SO IT MADE HER MORE INTERESTING FOR ONE WAS TEMPTED TO THINK THAT LOUISE HAD NOT THE POWER OF LOVING AT ALL
6540-232291-0067 YET FOR HIS OWN PART HE COULDN'T HELP LIKING HER THE EYES THAT HAD LOOKED INTO HIS AT THE STATION HAUNTED HIM A LITTLE AND WOULD NOT LET HIM THINK OF HER CONTEMPTUOUSLY BUT WHAT A WOMAN TO MAKE ONES WIFE UNLESS UNLESS
6540-232291-0068 LOUISE HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE EMMELINE APPROACHED HER HUSBAND THERE I FORESAW IT ISN'T VEXING NEVER MIND DEAR SHE'LL GO TO MORROW OR THE DAY AFTER
