8225-274376-0000 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRESBYTERIAN DISCIPLINE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED BUT INDULGED STILL IN AN ARDENT PASSION FOR PROPAGATING BY ALL METHODS THAT MODE OF RELIGION IN THE NEIGHBORING KINGDOMS HAVING FLATTERED THEMSELVES IN THE FERVOR OF THEIR ZEAL
8225-274376-0001 THAT BY SUPERNATURAL ASSISTANCES THEY SHOULD BE ENABLED TO CARRY THEIR TRIUMPHANT COVENANT TO THE GATES OF ROME ITSELF IT BEHOVED THEM FIRST TO RENDER IT PREVALENT IN ENGLAND WHICH ALREADY SHOWED SO GREAT A DISPOSITION TO RECEIVE IT
8225-274376-0002 THAN THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT IN ORDER TO ALLURE THAT NATION INTO A CLOSE CONFEDERACY OPENLY DECLARED THEIR WISHES OF ECCLESIASTICAL REFORMATION AND OF IMITATING THE EXAMPLE OF THEIR NORTHERN BRETHREN WHEN WAR WAS ACTUALLY COMMENCED THE SAME ARTIFICES WERE USED
8225-274376-0003 AND THE SCOTS BEHELD WITH THE UTMOST IMPATIENCE A SCENE OF ACTION OF WHICH THEY COULD NOT DEEM THEMSELVES INDIFFERENT SPECTATORS SHOULD THE KING THEY SAID BE ABLE BY FORCE OF ARMS TO PREVAIL OVER THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND AND REESTABLISH HIS AUTHORITY IN THAT POWERFUL KINGDOM
8225-274376-0004 HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY RETRACT ALL THOSE CONCESSIONS WHICH WITH SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES OF VIOLENCE AND INDIGNITY THE SCOTS HAVE EXTORTED FROM HIM BESIDES A SENSE OF HIS OWN INTEREST AND A REGARD TO ROYAL POWER WHICH HAS BEEN ENTIRELY ANNIHILATED IN THIS COUNTRY
8225-274376-0005 HIS VERY PASSION FOR PRELACY AND FOR RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES MUST LEAD HIM TO INVADE A CHURCH WHICH HE HAS EVER BEEN TAUGHT TO REGARD AS ANTI CHRISTIAN AND UNLAWFUL
8225-274376-0006 DOES NOT THE PARLIAMENT CONSIST OF THOSE VERY MEN WHO HAVE EVER OPPOSED ALL WAR WITH SCOTLAND WHO HAVE PUNISHED THE AUTHORS OF OUR OPPRESSIONS WHO HAVE OBTAINED US THE REDRESS OF EVERY GRIEVANCE AND WHO WITH MANY HONORABLE EXPRESSIONS
8225-274376-0007 NOT TO MENTION OUR OWN NECESSARY SECURITY CAN WE BETTER EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO HEAVEN FOR THAT PURE LIGHT WITH WHICH WE ARE ABOVE ALL NATIONS SO EMINENTLY DISTINGUISHED THAN BY CONVEYING THE SAME DIVINE KNOWLEDGE TO OUR UNHAPPY NEIGHBORS
8225-274376-0008 WHO ARE WADING THROUGH A SEA OF BLOOD IN ORDER TO ATTAIN IT THESE WERE IN SCOTLAND THE TOPICS OF EVERY CONVERSATION WITH THESE DOCTRINES THE PULPITS ECHOED AND THE FAMOUS CURSE OF MEROZ
8225-274376-0009 BUT WITH THE SAME SUCCESS AS BEFORE THE COMMISSIONERS WERE ALSO EMPOWERED TO PRESS THE KING ON THE ARTICLE OF RELIGION AND TO RECOMMEND TO HIM THE SCOTTISH MODEL OF ECCLESIASTIC WORSHIP AND DISCIPLINE
8225-274376-0010 THE ENGLISH DIVINES WENT AWAY FULL OF ADMIRATION AT THE BLIND ASSURANCE AND BIGOTED PREJUDICES OF THE MAN HE ON HIS PART WAS MOVED WITH EQUAL WONDER AT THEIR OBSTINATE ATTACHMENT TO SUCH PALPABLE ERRORS AND DELUSIONS BY THE CONCESSIONS WHICH THE KING HAD GRANTED TO SCOTLAND
8225-274376-0011 CHARLES FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE BY SOME DECISIVE ADVANTAGE TO REDUCE THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT TO A REASONABLE SUBMISSION AND MIGHT THEN EXPECT WITH SECURITY THE MEETING OF A SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
8225-274376-0012 THOUGH EARNESTLY SOLICITED BY LOUDON TO SUMMON PRESENTLY THAT GREAT COUNCIL OF THE NATION HE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO GIVE AUTHORITY TO MEN WHO HAD ALREADY EXCITED SUCH DANGEROUS COMMOTIONS AND WHO SHOWED STILL THE SAME DISPOSITION TO RESIST AND INVADE HIS AUTHORITY
8225-274376-0013 AND BEING LIKEWISE DENIED THIS REQUEST THEY RETURNED WITH EXTREME DISSATISFACTION TO EDINBURGH THE OFFICE OF CONSERVATORS OF THE PEACE WAS NEWLY ERECTED IN SCOTLAND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE CONFEDERACY BETWEEN THE TWO KINGDOMS AND THESE
8225-274376-0014 INSTIGATED BY THE CLERGY WERE RESOLVED SINCE THEY COULD NOT OBTAIN THE KING'S CONSENT TO SUMMON IN HIS NAME BUT BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY A CONVENTION OF STATES
8225-274376-0015 THE ONLY ONE WHICH REMAINED OF HIS PREROGATIVE UNDER COLOR OF PROVIDING FOR NATIONAL PEACE ENDANGERED BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ENGLISH ARMIES WAS A CONVENTION CALLED AN ASSEMBLY WHICH THOUGH IT MEETS WITH LESS SOLEMNITY
8225-274376-0016 HAS THE SAME AUTHORITY AS A PARLIAMENT IN RAISING MONEY AND LEVYING FORCES HAMILTON AND HIS BROTHER THE EARL OF LANERIC WHO HAD BEEN SENT INTO SCOTLAND IN ORDER TO OPPOSE THESE MEASURES WANTED EITHER AUTHORITY OR SINCERITY
8225-274376-0017 AND PASSIVELY YIELDED TO THE TORRENT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CHURCH MET AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE CONVENTION AND EXERCISING AN AUTHORITY ALMOST ABSOLUTE OVER THE WHOLE CIVIL POWER MADE EVERY POLITICAL CONSIDERATION YIELD TO THEIR THEOLOGICAL ZEAL AND PREJUDICES
8225-274376-0018 WHICH EFFACED ALL FORMER PROTESTATIONS AND VOWS TAKEN IN BOTH KINGDOMS AND LONG MAINTAINED ITS CREDIT AND AUTHORITY IN THIS COVENANT THE SUBSCRIBERS BESIDES ENGAGING MUTUALLY TO DEFEND EACH OTHER AGAINST ALL OPPONENTS BOUND THEMSELVES TO ENDEAVOR
8225-274376-0019 WITHOUT RESPECT OF PERSONS THE EXTIRPATION OF POPERY AND PRELACY SUPERSTITION
8225-274376-0020 AND REGARDED THEIR OWN MODEL AS THE ONLY ONE WHICH CORRESPONDED IN ANY DEGREE TO SUCH A DESCRIPTION BUT THAT ABLE POLITICIAN HAD OTHER VIEWS AND WHILE HE EMPLOYED HIS GREAT TALENTS IN OVERREACHING THE PRESBYTERIANS AND SECRETLY LAUGHED AT THEIR SIMPLICITY
8225-274376-0021 STILL RETAINED AN ATTACHMENT TO THE HIERARCHY AND TO THE ANCIENT MODES OF WORSHIP BUT IN THE PRESENT DANGER WHICH THREATENED THEIR CAUSE ALL SCRUPLES WERE LAID ASIDE AND THE COVENANT
8225-274376-0022 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY APPLAUDED THIS GLORIOUS IMITATION OF THE PIETY DISPLAYED BY THEIR ANCESTORS WHO THEY SAID IN THREE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS DURING THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH HAD ENDEAVORED TO ENGAGE THE ENGLISH BY PERSUASION
8225-274376-0023 BESIDES WHAT FURTHER PUNISHMENT IT SHOULD PLEASE THE ENSUING PARLIAMENT TO INFLICT ON THE REFUSERS AS ENEMIES TO GOD TO THE KING AND TO THE KINGDOM AND BEING DETERMINED THAT THE SWORD SHOULD CARRY CONVICTION TO ALL REFRACTORY MINDS
8225-274376-0024 IN HOPES THAT THIS KINGDOM FROM WHICH HIS CAUSE HAD ALREADY RECEIVED SO MUCH PREJUDICE MIGHT AT LENGTH CONTRIBUTE SOMEWHAT TOWARDS HIS PROTECTION AND SECURITY
8225-274376-0025 THESE TROOPS SO LONG AS THEY WERE ALLOWED TO REMAIN WERE USEFUL BY DIVERTING THE FORCE OF THE IRISH REBELS AND PROTECTING IN THE NORTH THE SMALL REMNANTS OF THE BRITISH PLANTERS BUT EXCEPT THIS CONTRACT WITH THE SCOTTISH NATION
8225-274376-0026 ALL THE OTHER MEASURES OF THE PARLIAMENT EITHER WERE HITHERTO ABSOLUTELY INSIGNIFICANT OR TENDED RATHER TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE PROTESTANT CAUSE IN IRELAND BY CONTINUING THEIR VIOLENT PERSECUTION AND STILL MORE VIOLENT MENACES AGAINST PRIESTS AND PAPISTS
8225-274376-0027 THEY CONFIRMED THE IRISH CATHOLICS IN THEIR REBELLION AND CUT OFF ALL HOPES OF INDULGENCE AND TOLERATION BY DISPOSING BEFOREHAND OF ALL THE IRISH FORFEITURES TO SUBSCRIBERS OR ADVENTURERS THEY RENDERED ALL MEN OF PROPERTY DESPERATE
8225-274376-0028 AND SEEMED TO THREATEN A TOTAL EXTIRPATION OF THE NATIVES AND WHILE THEY THUS INFUSED ZEAL AND ANIMOSITY INTO THE ENEMY NO MEASURE WAS PURSUED WHICH COULD TEND TO SUPPORT OR ENCOURAGE THE PROTESTANTS NOW REDUCED TO THE LAST EXTREMITIES
8225-274376-0029 SO GREAT IS THE ASCENDANT WHICH FROM A LONG COURSE OF SUCCESSES THE ENGLISH HAS ACQUIRED OVER THE IRISH NATION THAT THOUGH THE LATTER WHEN THEY RECEIVE MILITARY DISCIPLINE AMONG FOREIGNERS ARE NOT SURPASSED BY ANY TROOPS
8225-274376-0030 THEY HAVE NEVER IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE ANY VIGOROUS EFFORT FOR THE DEFENCE OR RECOVERY OF THEIR LIBERTIES IN MANY RENCOUNTERS THE ENGLISH UNDER LORD MORE SIR WILLIAM SAINT LEGER SIR FREDERIC HAMILTON AND OTHERS
8225-274376-0031 HAD THOUGH UNDER GREAT DISADVANTAGES OF SITUATION AND NUMBERS PUT THE IRISH TO ROUT AND RETURNED IN TRIUMPH TO DUBLIN THE REBELS RAISED THE SIEGE OF TREDAH
8225-274376-0032 EXCEPT THE FOURTH PART OF ONE SMALL VESSEL'S LADING DUBLIN TO SAVE ITSELF FROM STARVING HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SEND THE GREATER PART OF ITS INHABITANTS TO ENGLAND THE ARMY HAD LITTLE AMMUNITION SCARCELY EXCEEDING FORTY BARRELS OF GUNPOWDER
8225-274376-0033 THAT THE TWO NATIONS WHILE THEY CONTINUED THEIR FURIOUS ANIMOSITIES SHOULD MAKE DESOLATE THAT FERTILE ISLAND WHICH MIGHT SERVE TO THE SUBSISTENCE AND HAPPINESS OF BOTH
8225-274376-0034 THE KING AS HE HAD NEITHER MONEY ARMS AMMUNITION NOR PROVISIONS TO SPARE FROM HIS OWN URGENT WANTS RESOLVED TO EMBRACE AN EXPEDIENT WHICH MIGHT AT ONCE RELIEVE THE NECESSITIES OF THE IRISH PROTESTANTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND
8225-274376-0035 AND IT BECAME PRUDENT IN THE KING IF NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO EMBRACE SOME EXPEDIENT WHICH MIGHT SECURE THEM FOR A TIME FROM THE RUIN AND MISERY WITH WHICH THEY WERE THREATENED ACCORDINGLY THE KING GAVE ORDERS TO ORMOND AND THE JUSTICES TO CONCLUDE FOR A YEAR
8225-274376-0036 A CESSATION OF ARMS WITH THE COUNCIL OF KILKENNY BY WHOM THE IRISH WERE GOVERNED AND TO LEAVE BOTH SIDES IN POSSESSION OF THEIR PRESENT ADVANTAGES THE PARLIAMENT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO FIND FAULT WITH EVERY MEASURE ADOPTED BY THE OPPOSITE PARTY
8225-274376-0037 SOON AFTER DESERTED TO THE PARLIAMENT SOME IRISH CATHOLICS CAME OVER WITH THESE TROOPS AND JOINED THE ROYAL ARMY WHERE THEY CONTINUED THE SAME CRUELTIES AND DISORDERS TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED
