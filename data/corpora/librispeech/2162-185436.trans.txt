2162-185436-0000 IT WAS UPON AN EVENING IN SPAIN BUT WITH NOTHING WHICH THAT WORD EVOKES FOR US IN THE NORTH FOR IT WAS MERELY A LESSENING OF THE LIGHT WITHOUT DEWS WITHOUT MISTS AND WITHOUT SKIES THAT I CAME UP A STONY VALLEY
2162-185436-0001 AND SAW AGAINST THE RANDOM LINE OF THE PLATEAU AT ITS HEAD THE DOME OF A CHURCH THE ROAD I TRAVELLED WAS BUT FAINTLY MARKED
2162-185436-0002 THERE WERE BUT A FEW STAGNANT POOLS THE SHAPE OF THE DOME WAS ITALIAN AND IT SHOULD HAVE STOOD IN AN ITALIAN LANDSCAPE DRIER INDEED THAN THAT TO WHICH NORTHERNERS ARE ACCUSTOMED
2162-185436-0003 BUT STILL SURROUNDED BY TREES AND WITH A DISTANCE THAT COULD RENDER THINGS LIGHTLY BLUE INSTEAD OF THAT THIS LARGE BUILDING STOOD IN THE COMPLETE WASTE WHICH I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED AT SUCH LENGTH
2162-185436-0004 AS I APPROACHED THE BUILDING I SAW THAT THERE GATHERED ROUND IT A VILLAGE OR RATHER A GROUP OF DEPENDENT HOUSES FOR THE CHURCH WAS SO MUCH LARGER THAN ANYTHING IN THE PLACE AND THE MATERIAL OF WHICH THE CHURCH ITSELF AND THE HABITATIONS WERE BUILT WAS SO SIMILAR
2162-185436-0005 THE FLAT OLD TILED ROOFS ALL MIXED UNDER THE ADVANCE OF DARKNESS INTO SO UNITED A BODY THAT ONE WOULD HAVE SAID AS WAS PERHAPS HISTORICALLY THE TRUTH THAT THE CHURCH WAS NOT BUILT FOR THE NEEDS OF THE PLACE
2162-185436-0006 BUT THAT THE BOROUGH HAD GROWN ROUND THE SHRINE AND HAD SERVED FOR LITTLE SAVE TO HOUSE ITS SERVANTS WHEN THE LONG ASCENT WAS ENDED AND THE CREST REACHED WHERE THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY MERGED INTO THE UPPER PLAIN I PASSED INTO THE NARROW FIRST LANES
2162-185436-0007 IT WAS NOW QUITE DARK THE DARKNESS HAD COME SUDDENLY AND TO MAKE ALL THINGS CONSONANT THERE WAS NO MOON AND THERE WERE NOT ANY STARS CLOUDS HAD RISEN OF AN EVEN AND MENACING SORT AND ONE COULD SEE NO HEAVEN
2162-185436-0008 HERE AND THERE LIGHTS BEGAN TO SHOW IN THE HOUSES BUT MOST PEOPLE WERE IN THE STREET TALKING LOUDLY FROM THEIR DOORSTEPS TO EACH OTHER THEY WATCHED ME AS I CAME ALONG BECAUSE I WAS A FOREIGNER AND I WENT DOWN TILL I REACHED THE CENTRAL MARKET PLACE
2162-185436-0009 WONDERING HOW I SHOULD TELL THE BEST PLACE FOR SLEEP BUT LONG BEFORE MY CHOICE COULD BE MADE MY THOUGHTS WERE TURNED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BY FINDING MYSELF AT A TURN OF THE IRREGULAR PAVING RIGHT IN FRONT OF A VAST FACADE
2162-185436-0010 IN THE PRESENCE OF SO WONDERFUL A THING I FORGOT THE OBJECT OF MY JOURNEY AND THE IMMEDIATE CARE OF THE MOMENT AND I WENT THROUGH THE GREAT DOORS THAT OPENED ON THE PLACE THESE WERE CARVED
2162-185436-0011 AND BY THE LITTLE THAT LINGERED OF THE LIGHT AND THE GLIMMER OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT ON THE NEIGHBOURING WALL FOR THERE IS ELECTRIC LIGHT EVERYWHERE IN SPAIN BUT IT IS OFTEN OF A RED HEAT I COULD PERCEIVE THAT THESE DOORS WERE WONDERFULLY CARVED
2162-185436-0012 THE TWO DISTRICTS DIFFER ALTOGETHER SAVE IN THE HUMAN CHARACTER OF THOSE WHO INHABIT THEM THE ONE IS PASTORAL FULL OF DEEP MEADOWS AND PERPETUAL WOODS OF MINERALS AND OF COAL FOR MODERN ENERGY
2162-185436-0013 IN THE SPANISH TEMPER HAS KILLED THE GROTESQUE BOTH DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN MINGLED IN HISTORY YET IT IS NOT THE SPANIARD WHO HAS INVIGORATED THE DELTA OF THE RHINE AND THE HIGH COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH OF IT NOR THE WALLOONS AND THE FLEMINGS
2162-185436-0014 WHO HAVE TAUGHT THE SPANIARDS BUT EACH OF THESE HIGHLY SEPARATED PEOPLES RESEMBLES THE OTHER WHEN IT COMES TO THE OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF THE SOUL WHY I CANNOT TELL WITHIN THERE IS NOT A COMPLETE DARKNESS
2162-185436-0015 BUT A SERIES OF LIGHTS SHOWING AGAINST THE SILENCE OF THE BLACKNESS OF THE NAVE AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NAVE LIKE A GREAT FUNERAL THING WAS THE CHOIR WHICH THESE SPANISH CHURCHES HAVE PRESERVED AN INTACT TRADITION FROM THE ORIGINS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH
2162-185436-0016 GO TO THE EARLIEST OF THE BASILICAS IN ROME AND YOU WILL SEE THAT SACRED ENCLOSURE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EDIFICE AND TAKING UP A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THE WHOLE
2162-185436-0017 BUT HERE IN SPAIN THE EARLIEST FORMS OF CHRISTIAN EXTERNALS CRYSTALLIZED AS IT WERE THEY WERE THRUST LIKE AN INSULT OR A CHALLENGE AGAINST THE ASIATIC AS THE RECONQUEST OF THE DESOLATED PROVINCE PROCEEDED
2162-185436-0018 SHUTTING OUT THE PEOPLE FROM THE PRIESTS AND FROM THE MYSTERIES AS THEY HAD BEEN SHUT OUT WHEN THE WHOLE SYSTEM WAS ORGANIZED FOR DEFENCE AGAINST AN INIMICAL SOCIETY AROUND THE SILENCE OF THE PLACE WAS NOT COMPLETE
2162-185436-0019 NOR AS I HAVE SAID WAS THE DARKNESS AT THE FAR END OF THE CHOIR BEHIND THE HIGH ALTAR WAS THE LIGHT OF MANY CANDLES AND THERE WERE PEOPLE MURMURING OR WHISPERING THOUGH NOT AT PRAYERS
2162-185436-0020 AN EVENING RITE BUT AS I DID NOT KNOW THE LATIN FOR BENEDICTION I CALLED IT ALTERNATELY BENEDICTIO WHICH IS ENGLISH AND SALUS WHICH IS FRENCH HE SAID TWICE SI SI WHICH
2162-185436-0021 WHETHER IT WERE ITALIAN OR FRENCH OR LOCAL I UNDERSTOOD BY THE NODDING OF HIS HEAD
2162-185436-0022 VERY HEAVILY GILDED AND VERY OLD INDEED THE PATTERN OF THE CARVING WAS BARBARIC AND I THINK IT MUST HAVE DATED FROM THAT TURN OF THE DARK INTO THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN SO MUCH OF OUR CHRISTIAN WORK RESEMBLED THE WORK OF SAVAGES
2162-185436-0023 SPIRALS AND HIDEOUS HEADS AND SERPENTS AND OTHER THINGS BY THIS I WAS ALREADY ENORMOUSLY IMPRESSED AND BY A LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE AROUND OF WHOM PERHAPS HALF WERE CHILDREN
2162-185436-0024 WHEN THE YOUNG PRIEST TO WHOM I HAD SPOKEN APPROACHED AND CALLING A WELL DRESSED MAN OF THE MIDDLE CLASS WHO STOOD BY AND WHO HAD I SUPPOSE SOME LOCAL PROMINENCE
2162-185436-0025 CUT OFF FROM THE BODY LEANING SOMEWHAT SIDEWAYS AND CHANGED IN A TERRIBLE MANNER FROM THE EXPRESSION OF LIVING MEN
2162-185436-0026 BY THE VIOLENCE OF HIS DEATH TO THOSE INEXPERIENCED IN THE PRACTICE OF SUCH WORSHIP THERE MIGHT BE MORE EXCUSE FOR THE NOVEL IMPRESSION WHICH THIS SIGHT SUDDENLY PRODUCED UPON ME OUR RACE FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING
2162-185436-0027 NAY ALL THE RACES OF MEN HAVE PRESERVED THE FLESHLY MEMORIALS OF THOSE TO WHOM SANCTITY ATTACHED AND I HAVE SEEN SUCH RELICS IN MANY PARTS OF EUROPE ALMOST AS COMMONPLACES
2162-185436-0028 BUT FOR SOME REASON MY EMOTIONS UPON THAT EVENING WERE OF A DIFFERENT KIND THE LENGTH OF THE WAY FOR I WAS MILES AND MILES SOUTHWARDS OVER THIS DESERT WASTE THE IGNORANCE OF THE LANGUAGE WHICH SURROUNDED ME
2162-185436-0029 THE INHUMAN OUTLINE HOUR AFTER HOUR UNDER THE GLARE OF THE SUN OR IN THE INHOSPITABLE DARKNESS OF THIS HARD IBERIAN LAND THE STERNNESS OF THE FACES THE VIOLENT RICHNESS
2162-185436-0030 AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ARCHITECTURE ABOUT ME AND MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRIALS THROUGH WHICH THE PROVINCE HAD PASSED PUT ME IN THIS PRESENCE INTO A MOOD VERY DIFFERENT I THINK FROM THAT WHICH PILGRIMAGE IS CALCULATED TO AROUSE
2162-185436-0031 I WONDERED AS I LOOKED AT THAT FACE WHETHER HE HAD FALLEN IN PROTEST AGAINST THE MOHAMMEDANS OR AS HAVE SO MANY IN A SPANISH ENDURANCE OF TORTURE MARTYRED BY PAGANS IN THE PACIFIC SEAS
2162-185436-0032 AS I WRITE WHAT OCCASION IT WAS THAT MADE THIS HEAD SO GREAT THEY SAID BUT A FEW PRAYERS ALL FAMILIAR TO ME IN THE LATIN TONGUE THEN THE OUR FATHER AND SOME FEW OTHERS WHICH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RECITED IN THE VERNACULAR
2162-185436-0033 BUT WHAT AN INTONATION HAD I NOT HEARD THAT CHANT OFTEN ENOUGH IN MY LIFE TO CATCH ITS MEANING I HAD NEVER HEARD IT SET TO SUCH A TUNE IT WAS HARSH IT WAS FULL OF BATTLE AND THE SUPPLICATION IN IT THROBBED WITH PRESENT AND PHYSICAL AGONY
2162-185436-0034 HAD I CARED LESS FOR THE HUMAN BEINGS ABOUT ME SO MUCH SUFFERING SO MUCH NATIONAL TRADITION OF SUFFERING WOULD HAVE REVOLTED AS IT DID INDEED APPAL ME
2162-185436-0035 AND THE CHILDREN'S VOICES WERE VERY HIGH THEN THE PRIEST SHUT THE DOORS AND LOCKED THEM AND A BOY CAME AND BLEW THE CANDLES OUT ONE BY ONE AND I WENT OUT INTO THE MARKET PLACE FULLER THAN EVER OF SPAIN
