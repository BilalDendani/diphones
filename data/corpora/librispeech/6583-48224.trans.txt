6583-48224-0000 I HAVE VENTURED TO INTRODUCE TO MY READERS AS MY DEVIL MISTER UNDY SCOTT M P FOR THE TILLIETUDLEM DISTRICT BURGHS AND I ALSO FEEL MYSELF BOUND TO DISPOSE OF HIM THOUGH OF HIM
6583-48224-0001 I REGRET I CANNOT MAKE SO DECENT AN END AS WAS DONE WITH SIR RICHARD VARNEY AND BILL SYKES HE DESERVES HOWEVER AS SEVERE A FATE AS EITHER OF THOSE HEROES WITH THE FORMER WE WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPARE HIM
6583-48224-0002 THEY WERE BOTH APPARENTLY BORN TO PREY ON THEIR OWN SPECIES THEY BOTH RESOLUTELY ADHERED TO A FIXED RULE
6583-48224-0003 AND TO A RULE EQUALLY FIXED THAT THOUGH THEY WOULD EARN NO BREAD THEY WOULD CONSUME MUCH THEY WERE BOTH OF THEM BLESSED WITH A TOTAL ABSENCE OF SENSIBILITY AND AN UTTER DISREGARD TO THE PAIN OF OTHERS AND HAD
6583-48224-0004 NO OTHER USE FOR A HEART THAN THAT OF A MACHINE FOR MAINTAINING THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IT IS BUT LITTLE TO SAY THAT NEITHER OF THEM EVER ACTED ON PRINCIPLE ON A KNOWLEDGE THAT IS OF RIGHT AND WRONG
6583-48224-0005 AND A SELECTION OF THE RIGHT IN THEIR STUDIES OF THE SCIENCE OF EVIL THEY HAD PROGRESSED MUCH FURTHER THAN THIS AND HAD TAUGHT THEMSELVES TO BELIEVE THAT THAT WHICH OTHER MEN CALLED VIRTUE WAS ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT TO BE REGARDED AS MAWKISH INSIPID AND USELESS
6583-48224-0006 FOR SUCH PURPOSES AS THE ACQUISITION OF MONEY OR PLEASURE WHEREAS VICE WAS ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT TO BE PREFERRED AS OFFERING THE ONLY ROAD TO THOSE THINGS WHICH THEY WERE DESIROUS OF POSSESSING
6583-48224-0007 SO FAR THERE WAS A GREAT RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN BILL SYKES AND MISTER SCOTT BUT THEN CAME THE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE WHICH MUST GIVE TO THE LATTER A GREAT PRE EMINENCE IN THE EYES OF THAT MASTER WHOM THEY HAD BOTH SO WORTHILY SERVED
6583-48224-0008 BILL COULD NOT BOAST THE MERIT OF SELECTING THE COURSE WHICH HE HAD RUN HE HAD SERVED THE DEVIL HAVING HAD AS IT WERE NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER HE WAS BORN AND BRED AND EDUCATED AN EVIL DOER
6583-48224-0009 TO HIM HAD AT ANY RATE BEEN EXPLAINED THE THEORY OF MEUM AND TUUM AND HE HAD RESOLVED THAT HE LIKED TUUM BETTER THAN MEUM HE HAD LEARNT THAT THERE IS A GOD RULING OVER US AND A DEVIL HANKERING AFTER US
6583-48224-0010 THAT HE WOULD BELONG TO THE LATTER BREAD AND WATER WOULD HAVE COME TO HIM NATURALLY WITHOUT ANY VILLANY ON HIS PART AYE AND MEAT AND MILK AND WINE AND OIL THE FAT THINGS OF THE WORLD BUT HE ELECTED TO BE A VILLAIN
6583-48224-0011 HE LIKED TO DO THE DEVIL'S BIDDING SURELY HE WAS THE BETTER SERVANT SURELY HE SHALL HAVE THE RICHER REWARD AND YET POOR BILL SYKES FOR WHOM HERE I WOULD WILLINGLY SAY A WORD OR TWO
6583-48224-0012 IS ALWAYS HELD AS THE MORE DETESTABLE SCOUNDREL LADY
6583-48224-0013 WHEREAS YOUR BLOOD WOULD CREEP WITHIN YOU YOUR HAIR WOULD STAND ON END YOUR VOICE WOULD STICK IN YOUR THROAT IF YOU WERE SUDDENLY TOLD THAT BILL SYKES WAS IN YOUR PRESENCE POOR BILL I HAVE A SORT OF LOVE FOR HIM
6583-48224-0014 AS HE WALKS ABOUT WRETCHED WITH THAT DOG OF HIS THOUGH I KNOW THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO HANG HIM YES BILL I YOUR FRIEND CANNOT GAINSAY THAT MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HARD AS THE CASE MAY BE YOU MUST BE HUNG
6583-48224-0015 SEEING THAT YOU MAKE YOURSELF SO UNIVERSALLY DISAGREEABLE IT IS YOUR ORDAINED NATURE TO BE DISAGREEABLE YOU PLEAD SILENTLY I KNOW IT I ADMIT THE HARDSHIP OF YOUR CASE BUT STILL MY BILL
6583-48224-0016 BUT WITH WHAT A SAVAGE JOY WITH WHAT EXULTATION OF HEART WITH WHAT ALACRITY OF EAGER SOUL WITH WHAT APTITUDE OF MIND TO THE DEED WOULD I HANG MY FRIEND UNDY SCOTT THE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR THE TILLIETUDLEM BURGHS
6583-48224-0017 IN THIS THERE WOULD BE NO REGRET NO VACILLATION OF PURPOSE NO DOUBT AS TO THE PROPRIETY OF THE SACRIFICE NO FEELING THAT I WAS SO TREATING HIM NOT FOR HIS OWN DESERT BUT FOR MY ADVANTAGE WE HANG MEN I BELIEVE
6583-48224-0018 THAT WE SHOULD DETER OTHERS FROM CRIME BUT IN HANGING BILL WE SHALL HARDLY DETER HIS BROTHER BILL SYKES MUST LOOK TO CRIME FOR HIS BREAD SEEING THAT HE HAS BEEN SO EDUCATED SEEING THAT WE HAVE NOT YET TAUGHT HIM ANOTHER TRADE
6583-48224-0019 BUT IF I COULD HANG UNDY SCOTT I THINK I SHOULD DETER SOME OTHERS THE FIGURE OF UNDY SWINGING FROM A GIBBET AT THE BROAD END OF LOMBARD STREET WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT
6583-48224-0020 FATE HOWEVER AND THE LAWS ARE AVERSE TO GIBBET HIM IN ONE SENSE WOULD HAVE BEEN MY PRIVILEGE HAD I DRUNK DEEPER FROM THAT CASTALIAN
6583-48224-0021 BUT AS IN OTHER SENSE I MAY NOT HANG HIM I WILL TELL HOW HE WAS DRIVEN FROM HIS CLUB
6583-48224-0022 UNDY SCOTT AMONG HIS OTHER GOOD QUALITIES POSSESSED AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF THAT WHICH SCHOOLBOYS IN THESE DAYS CALL CHEEK HE WAS NOT EASILY BROWBEATEN AND WAS GENERALLY PREPARED TO BROWBEAT OTHERS
6583-48224-0023 MISTER CHAFFANBRASS CERTAINLY DID GET THE BETTER OF HIM BUT THEN MISTER CHAFFANBRASS WAS ON HIS OWN DUNGHILL COULD UNDY SCOTT HAVE HAD MISTER CHAFFANBRASS DOWN AT THE CLUBS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN PERHAPS ANOTHER TALE TO TELL
6583-48224-0024 AT ANY RATE BEFORE HIS PORTION OF THE WORLD HE MUST PERFORM SOME EXPLOIT UNCOMMONLY CHEEKY IN ORDER TO COVER HIS LATE DISCOMFITURE
6583-48224-0025 TO GET THE BETTER OF MISTER CHAFFANBRASS AT THE OLD BAILEY HAD BEEN BEYOND HIM BUT HE MIGHT YET DO SOMETHING AT THE CLUBS TO SET ASIDE THE UNANIMOUS VERDICT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN AGAINST HIM IN THE CITY NAY HE MUST DO SOMETHING
6583-48224-0026 HE HAD NOW RECEIVED A GREAT BLOW HE HAD STOOD BEFORE A CROWD AND BEEN ANNIHILATED BY THE BETTER CHEEK OF MISTER CHAFFANBRASS AND THEREFORE IT BEHOVED HIM AT ONCE TO DO SOMETHING WHEN THE PERFUME OF THE ROSE GROWS STALE
6583-48224-0027 THE FLOWER IS AT ONCE THROWN ASIDE AND CARRIED OFF AS FOUL REFUSE IT BEHOVED UNDY TO SEE THAT HIS PERFUME WAS MAINTAINED IN ITS PURITY OR HE TOO WOULD BE CARRIED OFF
6583-48224-0028 THE CLUB TO WHICH UNDY MORE ESPECIALLY BELONGED WAS CALLED THE DOWNING AND OF THIS ALARIC WAS ALSO A MEMBER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED INTO IT BY HIS FRIEND
6583-48224-0029 AND THERE WERE SUFFICIENT CLUB MEN REMAINING IN LONDON TO CREATE A DAILY GATHERING AT THE DOWNING ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THAT ON WHICH THE VERDICT WAS FOUND UNDY CONVENED A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE CLUB IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT SUBMIT TO IT A PROPOSITION
6583-48224-0030 WHICH HE THOUGHT IT INDISPENSABLE SHOULD COME FROM HIM SO AT LEAST HE DECLARED THE COMMITTEE DID ASSEMBLE AND WHEN UNDY MET IT HE SAW AMONG THE FACES BEFORE HIM NOT A FEW WITH WHOM HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DISPENSED HOWEVER
6583-48224-0031 I NEED NOT TROUBLE MY READERS WITH THE NEAT LITTLE SPEECH IN WHICH IT WAS MADE UNDY WAS TRUE TO HIMSELF AND THE SPEECH WAS NEAT THE PROPOSITION WAS THIS THAT AS HE HAD UNFORTUNATELY BEEN THE MEANS OF INTRODUCING MISTER ALARIC TUDOR TO THE CLUB
6583-48224-0032 HE CONSIDERED IT TO BE HIS DUTY TO SUGGEST THAT THE NAME OF THAT GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE STRUCK OFF THE BOOKS HE THEN EXPRESSED HIS UNMITIGATED DISGUST AT THE CRIME OF WHICH TUDOR HAD BEEN FOUND GUILTY UTTERED SOME NICE LITTLE PLATITUDES
6583-48224-0033 AND EXPRESSED A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT SO FAR REFER TO A PERSONAL MATTER AS TO SAY THAT HIS FATHER'S FAMILY WOULD TAKE CARE THAT THE LADY WHOSE FORTUNE HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF THE TRIAL SHOULD NOT LOSE ONE PENNY THROUGH THE DISHONESTY OF HER TRUSTEE
6583-48224-0034 NO TEN OR TWENTY COMBINED VOICES EXPRESSED BY THEIR CLAMOROUS NEGATION OF THE LAST PROPOSED PROCESS THAT THEIR UNDY WAS ABOVE REPROACH THE EYES AROUND LOOKED INTO HIM
6583-48224-0035 UNDY UNDY MORE CHEEK STILL STILL MORE CHEEK OR YOU ARE SURELY LOST IF SAID HE IN A WELL ASSUMED INDIGNANT TONE OF INJURED INNOCENCE THERE BE
6583-48224-0036 BUT IN SUCH CASE I DEMAND THAT THE INVESTIGATION BE IMMEDIATE OH UNDY UNDY
6583-48224-0037 BUT YET IT SUFFICES THEE NOT CAN THERE BE POSITIONS IN THIS MODERN WEST END WORLD OF MINE THOUGHT UNDY TO HIMSELF IN WHICH CHEEK UNBOUNDED CHEEK WILL NOT SUFFICE OH UNDY THEY ARE RARE
6583-48224-0038 WOULD UNDY HAVE WISHED TO SEE UNCONCERNED WITH THESE MATTERS
6583-48224-0039 FOR REMOVING MISTER TUDOR FROM AMONGST THEM HE HAD WATCHED THIS TRIAL WITH SOME CARE AND HE PITIED MISTER TUDOR FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART
6583-48224-0040 BUT MISTER TUDOR HAD BEEN CONVICTED
6583-48224-0041 ONE OF THESE PENALTIES MUST UNDOUBTEDLY BE HIS BANISHMENT FROM THIS CLUB HE THEREFORE SECONDED MISTER SCOTT'S PROPOSAL HE THEN STOOD SILENT FOR A MOMENT HAVING FINISHED THAT TASK BUT YET HE DID NOT SIT DOWN
6583-48224-0042 WHY OH WHY DOES HE NOT SIT DOWN WHY O UNDY DOES HE THUS STAND
6583-48224-0043 AND NOW HE SAID HE HAD ANOTHER PROPOSITION TO MAKE
6583-48224-0044 AND HAVING SO SPOKEN IN A VOICE OF UNUSUAL ENERGY HE THEN SAT DOWN AND NOW UNDY YOU MAY AS WELL PACK UP AND BE OFF WITHOUT FURTHER FUSS TO BOULOGNE OSTEND OR SOME SUCH IDLE
6583-48224-0045 ELYSIUM WITH SUCH MONEY SCRAPINGS AS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO COLLECT TOGETHER NO IMPORTUNITY WILL AVAIL THEE
6583-48224-0046 THAN ALL THAT MISTER CHAFFANBRASS COULD SAY COME PACK UP AND BEGONE BUT HE WAS STILL A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
6583-48224-0047 IT WOULD BE USELESS FOR HIM TO STAND AGAIN HE LIKE MISTER
6583-48224-0048 AND HE RECOGNIZED THE NECESSITY OF VANISHING HE AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT HIS LIFE AS A LEGISLATOR MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO COME TO A NATURAL END THAT HE MIGHT DIE AS IT WERE IN HIS BED WITHOUT SUFFERING THE ACUTE PAIN OF APPLYING FOR THE
6583-48224-0049 HE APPLIED AT ONCE FOR THE NOW COVETED SINECURE AND WAS REFUSED HER MAJESTY COULD NOT CONSENT TO ENTRUST TO HIM THE DUTIES OF THE SITUATION IN QUESTION
6583-48224-0050 AND NOW INDEED IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO PACK AND BEGONE HE WAS NOW LIABLE TO THE VULGAREST PERSECUTION FROM THE VULGAR HERD HIS VERY TAILOR AND BOOTMAKER WOULD BELEAGUER HIM
6583-48224-0051 AND COARSE UNWASHED BAILIFFS TAKE HIM BY THE COLLAR YES NOW INDEED IT WAS TIME TO BE OFF AND OFF HE WAS
6583-48224-0052 AT CAULDKAIL CASTLE COLLECTING WHAT LITTLE HE MIGHT ANOTHER TO HIS HONOURABLE WIFE ADDING SOME SLENDER INCREASE TO HIS LITTLE BUDGET AND THEN HE WAS OFF WHITHER IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY TO HAMBURG PERHAPS
6583-48224-0053 OR TO EMS OR THE RICHER TABLES OF HOMBURG HOW HE FLOURISHED FOR A WHILE WITH AMBIGUOUS SUCCESS HOW HE TALKED TO THE YOUNG ENGLISH TOURISTS OF WHAT HE HAD DONE WHEN IN PARLIAMENT ESPECIALLY FOR THE RIGHTS OF MARRIED WOMEN
6583-48224-0054 HOW HE POKED HIS HONOURABLE CARD IN EVERY ONE'S WAY AND LUGGED LORD GABERLUNZIE INTO ALL CONVERSATIONS
6583-48224-0055 AND TRYING TO LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD IN HIS POCKET AMPLE MEANS TO SECURE THOSE HOARDS OF MONEY WHICH MEN ARE SO LISTLESSLY RAKING ABOUT FROM OUR VIEW HE HAS NOW VANISHED IT WAS A BITTER FEBRUARY MORNING
6583-48224-0056 MILLBANK IT WAS HARDLY YET SIX O'CLOCK AND PARADISE ROW WAS DARK AS EREBUS THAT SOLITARY GAS LIGHT STICKING OUT FROM THE WALL OF THE PRISON ONLY MADE DARKNESS VISIBLE

6583-48224-0058 AND THEN HAVING GIVEN DUE DIRECTIONS TO THE DRIVER HE NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY SQUEEZED HIMSELF INTO THE REMAINING SPACE SUCH JOURNEYS AS THESE ARE ALWAYS MADE AT A SLOW PACE
6583-48224-0059 CABMEN KNOW VERY WELL WHO MUST GO FAST AND WHO MAY GO SLOW WOMEN WITH CHILDREN GOING ON BOARD AN EMIGRANT VESSEL AT SIX O'CLOCK ON A FEBRUARY MORNING MAY BE TAKEN VERY SLOWLY
6583-48224-0060 AND VERY SLOWLY GERTRUDE AND HER PARTY WERE TAKEN TIME HAD BEEN NAY IT WAS BUT THE OTHER DAY WHEN ALARIC'S IMPATIENT SOUL WOULD HAVE SPURNED AT SUCH A PACE AS THIS BUT NOW HE SAT TRANQUIL ENOUGH
6583-48224-0061 AND WOULD ON THE MORROW SEPARATE PERHAPS FOR EVER A MOTHER AND A CHILD WHO LOVED EACH OTHER SO DEARLY NO ONE SPOKE TO HIM OF THIS PERHAPS NO ONE THOUGHT OF IT HE HOWEVER
6583-48224-0062 DID SO THINK OF IT THAT HE COULD NOT HOLD HIS HEAD UP BEFORE THEM HE WAS ILL GERTRUDE SAID HIS LONG CONFINEMENT HAD PROSTRATED HIM BUT THE SEA AIR WOULD REVIVE HIM IN A DAY OR TWO
6583-48224-0063 LINGER LINGER TILL EVERY SHRED OF PATIENCE WAS CLEAN WORN OUT THEY GOT TO THE DOCKS IN TIME AND GOT ON BOARD THAT FAST SAILING CLIPPER BUILT NEVER BEATEN ALWAYS HEALTHY SHIP THE FLASH OF LIGHTNING

6583-48224-0067 THE WORLD WE THINK MAKES A GREAT MISTAKE ON THE SUBJECT OF SAYING OR ACTING FAREWELL
6583-48224-0068 BUT WE ALL DRAWL THROUGH IT AT A SNAIL'S PACE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO TEAR OURSELVES FROM OUR FRIENDS BUT TEARING IS A PROCESS WHICH SHOULD BE DONE QUICKLY WHAT IS SO WRETCHED AS LINGERING OVER A LAST KISS
