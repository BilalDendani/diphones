4463-26871-0010 NICHOLAS AND HIS WIFE LIVED TOGETHER SO HAPPILY THAT EVEN SONYA AND THE OLD COUNTESS WHO FELT JEALOUS AND WOULD HAVE LIKED THEM TO DISAGREE COULD FIND NOTHING TO REPROACH THEM WITH BUT EVEN THEY HAD THEIR MOMENTS OF ANTAGONISM OCCASIONALLY
4463-26871-0011 AND IT WAS ALWAYS JUST AFTER THEY HAD BEEN HAPPIEST TOGETHER THEY SUDDENLY HAD A FEELING OF ESTRANGEMENT AND HOSTILITY WHICH OCCURRED MOST FREQUENTLY DURING COUNTESS MARY'S PREGNANCIES AND THIS WAS SUCH A TIME
