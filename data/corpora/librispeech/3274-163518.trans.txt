3274-163518-0000 THE MASTER THIEF ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A POOR COTTAGER WHO HAD THREE SONS HE HAD NOTHING TO LEAVE THEM WHEN HE DIED AND NO MONEY WITH WHICH TO PUT THEM TO ANY TRADE SO THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THEM
3274-163518-0001 AT LAST HE SAID HE WOULD GIVE THEM LEAVE TO TAKE TO ANYTHING EACH LIKED BEST AND TO GO WHITHERSOEVER THEY PLEASED AND HE WOULD GO WITH THEM A BIT OF THE WAY AND SO HE DID HE WENT WITH THEM TILL THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THREE ROADS MET AND THERE EACH OF THEM CHOSE A ROAD AND THEIR FATHER BADE THEM GOOD BYE
3274-163518-0002 I HAVE NEVER HEARD TELL WHAT BECAME OF THE TWO ELDER
3274-163518-0003 HE GOT BEWILDERED AND COULD NOT FIND EITHER ROAD OR PATH BUT AS HE WENT ON AND ON AT LAST HE SAW A GLIMMERING OF LIGHT FAR FAR OFF IN THE WOOD
3274-163518-0004 AND SAW AN OLD DAME BUSTLING ABOUT AND MINDING THE HOUSE GOOD EVENING SAID THE YOUTH GOOD EVENING SAID THE OLD DAME HUTETU IT'S SUCH FOUL WEATHER OUT OF DOORS TO NIGHT SAID HE SO IT IS SAID SHE
3274-163518-0005 CAN I GET LEAVE TO HAVE A BED AND SHELTER HERE TO NIGHT ASKED THE YOUTH YOU'LL GET NO GOOD BY SLEEPING HERE SAID THE OLD DAME
3274-163518-0006 SAID THE OLD DAME THEY STOLE ME AWAY WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND HAVE KEPT ME AS THEIR HOUSEKEEPER EVER SINCE WELL FOR ALL THAT I THINK I'LL JUST GO TO BED SAID THE YOUTH
3274-163518-0007 DID YOU SEE IF HE HAD ANY MONEY SAID THE ROBBERS SUCH A ONE AS HE MONEY SAID THE OLD DAME THE TRAMPER WHY IF HE HAD CLOTHES TO HIS BACK IT WAS AS MUCH AS HE HAD THEN THE ROBBERS BEGAN TO TALK AMONG THEMSELVES WHAT THEY SHOULD DO WITH HIM
3274-163518-0008 IF THEY SHOULD KILL HIM OUTRIGHT OR WHAT ELSE THEY SHOULD DO MEANTIME THE YOUTH GOT UP AND BEGAN TO TALK TO THEM
3274-163518-0009 WELL HAVE YOU A MIND TO STEAL ASKED THE ROBBERS I DON'T CARE SAID THE YOUTH FOR HE THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT TAKE LONG TO LEARN THAT TRADE NOW THERE LIVED A MAN A LITTLE WAY OFF WHO HAD THREE OXEN
3274-163518-0010 SO THEY SAID TO THE YOUTH IF HE WERE GOOD TO STEAL THE OX FROM THE MAN BY THE WAY WITHOUT HIS KNOWING IT AND WITHOUT DOING HIM ANY HARM THEY WOULD GIVE HIM LEAVE TO BE THEIR SERVING MAN WELL THE YOUTH SET OFF AND TOOK WITH HIM A PRETTY SHOE WITH A SILVER BUCKLE ON IT WHICH LAY ABOUT THE HOUSE
3274-163518-0011 AND HE PUT THE SHOE IN THE ROAD ALONG WHICH THE MAN WAS GOING WITH HIS OX
3274-163518-0012 SO WHEN THE MAN CAME BY HE SAW THE SHOE AT ONCE THAT'S A NICE SHOE
3274-163518-0013 THEN THE YOUTH TOOK UP THE SHOE AND MADE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD TO GET BEFORE THE MAN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE WOOD AND LAID IT DOWN BEFORE HIM IN THE ROAD AGAIN WHEN THE MAN CAME ALONG WITH HIS OX HE GOT QUITE ANGRY WITH HIMSELF FOR BEING SO DULL AS TO LEAVE THE FELLOW TO THE SHOE LYING IN THE ROAD INSTEAD OF TAKING IT WITH HIM
3274-163518-0014 I MAY JUST AS WELL RUN BACK AND PICK UP THE OTHER AND THEN I'LL HAVE A PAIR OF GOOD SHOES FOR MY OLD DAME AND SO PERHAPS I'LL GET A KIND WORD FROM HER FOR ONCE SO HE SET OFF AND HUNTED AND HUNTED UP AND DOWN FOR THE SHOE BUT NO SHOE DID HE FIND
3274-163518-0015 BUT JUST THEN IT CAME ACROSS HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD GO HOME AND TAKE THE SECOND OX AND DRIVE IT TO THE TOWN AND NOT LET HIS OLD DAME KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER SO HE DID THIS AND WENT HOME AND TOOK THE OX WITHOUT HIS DAME'S KNOWING IT AND SET OFF WITH IT TO THE TOWN
3274-163518-0016 BUT THE ROBBERS KNEW ALL ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID TO THE YOUTH IF HE COULD GET THIS OX TOO WITHOUT THE MAN'S KNOWING IT AND WITHOUT HIS DOING HIM ANY HARM HE SHOULD BE AS GOOD AS ANY ONE OF THEM IF THAT WERE ALL THE YOUTH SAID HE DID NOT THINK IT A VERY HARD THING THIS TIME
3274-163518-0017 HE TOOK WITH HIM A ROPE AND HUNG HIMSELF UP UNDER THE ARM PITS TO A TREE RIGHT IN THE MAN'S WAY SO THE MAN CAME ALONG WITH HIS OX AND WHEN HE SAW SUCH A SIGHT HANGING THERE HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE QUEER WELL SAID HE
3274-163518-0018 WHATEVER HEAVY THOUGHTS YOU HAD WHO HAVE HANGED YOURSELF UP THERE IT CAN'T BE HELPED YOU MAY HANG FOR WHAT I CARE I CAN'T BREATHE LIFE INTO YOU AGAIN AND WITH THAT HE WENT ON HIS WAY WITH HIS OX DOWN SLIPPED THE YOUTH FROM THE TREE AND RAN BY A FOOTPATH AND GOT BEFORE THE MAN
3274-163518-0019 AND HUNG HIMSELF UP RIGHT IN HIS WAY AGAIN BLESS ME SAID THE MAN WERE YOU REALLY SO HEAVY AT HEART THAT YOU HANGED YOURSELF UP THERE
3274-163518-0020 AYE AYE YOU MAY HANG FOR ALL I CARE WHETHER YOU ARE A GHOST OR WHATEVER YOU ARE SO HE PASSED ON WITH HIS OX NOW THE YOUTH DID JUST AS HE HAD DONE TWICE BEFORE HE JUMPED DOWN FROM THE TREE RAN THROUGH THE WOOD BY A FOOTPATH AND HUNG HIMSELF UP RIGHT IN THE MAN'S WAY AGAIN
3274-163518-0021 BUT WHEN THE MAN SAW THIS SIGHT FOR THE THIRD TIME
3274-163518-0022 WELL THIS IS AN UGLY BUSINESS IS IT LIKELY NOW THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO HEAVY AT HEART AS TO HANG THEMSELVES ALL THESE THREE NO I CANNOT THINK IT IS ANYTHING ELSE THAN A PIECE OF WITCHCRAFT THAT I SEE BUT NOW I'LL SOON KNOW FOR CERTAIN
3274-163518-0023 IF THE OTHER TWO ARE STILL HANGING THERE IT MUST BE REALLY SO BUT IF THEY ARE NOT THEN IT CAN BE NOTHING BUT WITCHCRAFT THAT I SEE SO HE TIED UP HIS OX AND RAN BACK TO SEE IF THE OTHERS WERE STILL REALLY HANGING THERE BUT WHILE HE WENT AND PEERED UP INTO ALL THE TREES
3274-163518-0024 THE YOUTH JUMPED DOWN AND TOOK HIS OX AND RAN OFF WITH IT WHEN THE MAN CAME BACK AND FOUND HIS OX GONE HE WAS IN A SAD PLIGHT AND AS ANY ONE MIGHT KNOW WITHOUT BEING TOLD HE BEGAN TO CRY AND BEMOAN BUT AT LAST HE CAME TO TAKE IT EASIER AND SO HE THOUGHT
3274-163518-0025 THERE'S NO OTHER HELP FOR IT THAN TO GO HOME AND TAKE THE THIRD OX WITHOUT MY DAME'S KNOWING IT AND TO TRY AND DRIVE A GOOD BARGAIN WITH IT SO THAT I MAY GET A GOOD SUM OF MONEY FOR IT SO HE WENT HOME AND SET OFF WITH THE OX AND HIS OLD DAME KNEW NEVER A WORD ABOUT THE MATTER BUT THE ROBBERS
3274-163518-0026 THEY KNEW ALL ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID TO THE YOUTH THAT IF HE COULD STEAL THIS OX AS HE HAD STOLEN THE OTHER TWO THEN HE SHOULD BE MASTER OVER THE WHOLE BAND WELL THE YOUTH SET OFF AND RAN INTO THE WOOD AND AS THE MAN CAME BY WITH HIS OX HE SET UP A DREADFUL BELLOWING
3274-163518-0027 JUST LIKE A GREAT OX IN THE WOOD WHEN THE MAN HEARD THAT YOU CAN'T THINK HOW GLAD HE WAS FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE KNEW THE VOICE OF HIS BIG BULLOCK AND HE THOUGHT THAT NOW HE SHOULD FIND BOTH OF THEM AGAIN
3274-163518-0028 AND RAN OFF FROM THE ROAD TO LOOK FOR THEM IN THE WOOD BUT MEANTIME THE YOUTH WENT OFF WITH THE THIRD OX NOW WHEN THE MAN CAME BACK AND FOUND HE HAD LOST THIS OX TOO HE WAS SO WILD THAT THERE WAS NO END TO HIS GRIEF HE CRIED AND ROARED AND BEAT HIS BREAST
3274-163518-0029 AND TO TELL THE TRUTH IT WAS MANY DAYS BEFORE HE DARED GO HOME FOR HE WAS AFRAID LEST HIS OLD DAME SHOULD KILL HIM OUTRIGHT ON THE SPOT AS FOR THE ROBBERS THEY WERE NOT VERY WELL PLEASED EITHER WHEN THEY HAD TO OWN THAT THE YOUTH WAS MASTER OVER THE WHOLE BAND SO ONE DAY
3274-163518-0030 AND THEY SET OFF ALL TOGETHER EVERY MAN JACK OF THEM AND LEFT HIM ALONE AT HOME NOW THE FIRST THING THAT HE DID WHEN THEY WERE ALL WELL CLEAR OF THE HOUSE WAS TO DRIVE THE OXEN OUT TO THE ROAD
3274-163518-0031 AND RIGHT GLAD HE WAS TO SEE THEM AS YOU MAY FANCY NEXT HE TOOK ALL THE HORSES WHICH THE ROBBERS HAD AND LOADED THEM WITH THE BEST THINGS HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON GOLD AND SILVER AND CLOTHES AND OTHER FINE THINGS AND THEN HE BADE THE OLD DAME TO GREET THE ROBBERS WHEN THEY CAME BACK AND TO THANK THEM FOR HIM
3274-163518-0032 AND WHICH WAS MADE JUST LIKE A GENERAL'S SO HE DROVE UP TO THE DOOR AS IF HE WERE ANY OTHER GREAT MAN
3274-163518-0033 NO THAT HE COULDN'T AT ANY PRICE HOW EVER SHOULD I BE ABLE SAID THE MAN TO MAKE ROOM IN MY HOUSE FOR SUCH A FINE GENTLEMAN I WHO SCARCE HAVE A RAG TO LIE UPON AND MISERABLE RAGS TOO YOU ALWAYS WERE A STINGY OLD HUNKS SAID THE YOUTH
3274-163518-0034 AND SO YOU ARE STILL WHEN YOU WON'T TAKE YOUR OWN SON IN WHAT YOU MY SON SAID THE MAN DON'T YOU KNOW ME AGAIN SAID THE YOUTH WELL AFTER A LITTLE WHILE HE DID KNOW HIM AGAIN BUT WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TURNING YOUR HAND TO
3274-163518-0035 THAT YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF SO GREAT A MAN IN SUCH HASTE ASKED THE MAN OH I'LL SOON TELL YOU SAID THE YOUTH
3274-163518-0036 AND NOW I'VE SERVED MY TIME OUT AND AM BECOME A MASTER THIEF NOW THERE LIVED A SQUIRE CLOSE BY TO HIS FATHER'S COTTAGE AND HE HAD SUCH A GREAT HOUSE AND SUCH HEAPS OF MONEY HE COULD NOT TELL HOW MUCH HE HAD HE HAD A DAUGHTER TOO AND A SMART AND PRETTY GIRL SHE WAS
3274-163518-0037 AND HE TOLD HIS FATHER TO GO TO THE SQUIRE AND ASK FOR HIS DAUGHTER FOR HIM IF HE ASKS BY WHAT TRADE I GET MY LIVING YOU CAN SAY I'M A MASTER THIEF I THINK YOU'VE LOST YOUR WITS SAID THE MAN FOR YOU CAN'T BE IN YOUR RIGHT MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF SUCH STUFF
3274-163518-0038 YES THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT SAID THE MASTER THIEF HE SHOULD GO WHETHER HE WOULD OR NO AND IF HE DID NOT GO BY FAIR MEANS HE WOULD SOON MAKE HIM GO BY FOUL BUT THE MAN WAS STILL LOATH TO GO
3274-163518-0039 SO HE STEPPED AFTER HIM AND RUBBED HIM DOWN WITH A GOOD BIRCH CUDGEL AND KEPT ON TILL THE MAN CAME CRYING AND SOBBING INSIDE THE SQUIRE'S DOOR HOW NOW MY MAN WHAT AILS YOU SAID THE SQUIRE SO HE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY HOW HE HAD THREE SONS WHO SET OFF ONE DAY
3274-163518-0040 THAT HE'S A MASTER THIEF AND SO HE FELL TO CRYING AND SOBBING AGAIN
