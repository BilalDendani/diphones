5299-34546-0000 IT IS HARD ENOUGH TO THINK OF LIVES GOING OUT STILL AS THE DOCTOR WAS SO FOND OF SAYING MAN IS BORN TO DIE AND WOMAN TOO BUT THAT THE GREAT WORKS OF MEN HIS BEQUEST TO THE COMING GENERATIONS SHOULD BE WANTONLY DESTROYED
5299-34546-0001 SEEMED EVEN MORE HORRIBLE ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO LOVE BEAUTY AND THE IDEA OF THE CHARRED LEAVES OF THE LIBRARY FLYING IN THE AIR ABOVE THE HISTORIC CITY OF CATHOLIC CULTURE MADE US ALL FEEL AS IF WE WERE SITTING DOWN TO A FUNERAL SERVICE RATHER THAN A VERY GOOD DINNER
5299-34546-0002 HAD RINGS ROUND HER EYES WHICH TOLD OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND WHY WE WERE MERE SPECTATORS WE HAD BEEN INTERESTED TO DISPUTE AND LOOK ON BUT SHE KNEW THAT SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IN THE NORTHEAST HER MAN WAS CARRYING A GUN
5299-34546-0003 YET ALL ABOUT US THE COUNTRY WAS SO LOVELY AND SO TRANQUIL HORSES WERE WALKING THE FIELDS AND EVEN AS WE SAT AT DINNER WE COULD HEAR THE VOICES AND THE HEAVY FEET OF THE PEASANT WOMEN AS THEY WENT HOME FROM THEIR WORK
5299-34546-0004 THE GARDEN HAD NEVER BEEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN IT WAS THAT EVENING WITH THE SILVER LIGHT OF THE MOON THROUGH THE TREES AND THE SMELL OF THE FRESHLY WATERED EARTH AND FLOWERS WE HAD NO DOUBT WHO WAS TO CONTRIBUTE THE STORY THE DIVORCEE WAS DRESSED WITH UNUSUAL CARE FOR THE ROLE
5299-34546-0005 AND CARRIED A BIG LACE BAG ON HER ARM AND AS SHE LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR SHE PULLED ONE OF THE BIG OLD FASHIONED CANDLES IN ITS DEEP GLASS TOWARD HER AND SAID WITH A NERVOUS LAUGH
5299-34546-0006 YOU KNOW I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS SORT OF THING IT IS REALLY MY VERY FIRST APPEARANCE AND I COULD NOT POSSIBLY TELL IT AS THE REST OF YOU MORE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE CAN DO AND SHE TOOK THE MANUSCRIPT OUT OF HER LACE BAG AND SETTLING HERSELF GRACEFULLY UNROLLED IT
5299-34546-0007 THE YOUNGSTER PUT A STOOL UNDER HER PRETTY FEET AND THE DOCTOR SET A CUSHION BEHIND HER BACK WHILE THE JOURNALIST WITH A LAUGH POURED HER A GLASS OF WATER AND THE VIOLINIST CEREMONIOUSLY LEANED OVER AND ASKED SHALL I TURN FOR YOU SHE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING
5299-34546-0008 BUT IT DID NOT MAKE HER ANY THE LESS NERVOUS OR HER VOICE ANY THE LESS SHAKY AS SHE BEGAN IT WAS AFTER DINNER ON ONE OF THOSE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN THEY DINED ALONE TOGETHER THEY WERE TAKING COFFEE IN MISSUS SHATTUCK'S ESPECIAL CORNER OF THE DRAWING ROOM
5299-34546-0009 AND SHE HAD JUST ASKED HER HUSBAND TO SMOKE SHE WAS LEANING BACK COMFORTABLY IN A NEST OF CUSHIONS IN HER VERY LATEST GOWN WITH A MOST BECOMING LIGHT FALLING ON HER FROM THE TALL YELLOW SHADED LAMP
5299-34546-0010 HE WAS FACING HER ASTRIDE HIS CHAIR IN A POSITION MAN HAS LOVED SINCE CREATION HE WAS JUST THINKING THAT HIS WIFE HAD NEVER LOOKED HANDSOMER FINER IN FACT IN ALL HER LIFE QUITE THE SATISFACTORY ALL ROUND DESIRABLE SORT OF A WOMAN
5299-34546-0011 A MAN'S WIFE OUGHT TO BE SHE WAS WONDERING IF HE WOULD EVER BE ANY LESS ATTRACTIVE TO ALL WOMEN THAN HE WAS NOW AT FORTY TWO OR ANY BETTER ABLE TO RESIST HIS OWN POWER AS SHE PUT HER COFFEE CUP BACK ON THE TINY TABLE AT HER ELBOW
5299-34546-0012 HE LEANED FORWARD AND PICKED UP A BOOK WHICH LAY OPEN ON A CHAIR NEAR HIM AND CARELESSLY GLANCED AT IT SCHOPENHAUER AND HE WRINKLED HIS BROWS AND GLANCED HALF WHIMSICALLY DOWN THE PAGE I NEVER CAN GET USED TO A WOMAN READING THAT STUFF AND IN FRENCH AT THAT
5299-34546-0013 IF YOU TOOK IT UP TO PERFECT YOUR GERMAN THERE WOULD BE SOME SENSE IN IT MISSUS SHATTUCK DID NOT REPLY WHEN A MOMENT LATER SHE DID SPEAK IT WAS TO IGNORE HIS REMARK UTTERLY AND ASK
5299-34546-0014 THE KAISER WILHELM GOT OFF IN GOOD SEASON THIS MORNING SPEAKING OF GERMAN THINGS OH YES WAS THE INDIFFERENT REPLY AT TEN O'CLOCK QUITE PROMPTLY I SUPPOSE SHE WAS COMFORTABLE
5299-34546-0015 CERTAINLY ONE OF YOUR BEASTLY HEAD ACHES SHE UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU
5299-34546-0016 STILL TURNING THE LEAVES OF THE BOOK HE HELD THAT THIS PLEASES YOU NOT EXACTLY WELL AMUSES YOU INSTRUCTS YOU IF YOU LIKE THAT BETTER NO I MEAN TO SAY SIMPLY SINCE YOU INSIST THAT HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH
5299-34546-0017 AND THERE ARE SOME EVEN AMONG WOMEN WHO MUST KNOW THE TRUTH AND ABIDE BY IT WELL THANK HEAVEN SAID THE MAN PULLING AT HIS CIGAR THAT MOST WOMEN ARE MORE EMOTIONAL THAN INTELLIGENT AS NATURE MEANT THEM TO BE
5299-34546-0018 MISSUS SHATTUCK EXAMINED HER DAINTILY POLISHED NAILS RUBBED THEM CAREFULLY ON THE PALM OF HER HAND AS WOMEN HAVE A TRICK OF DOING
5299-34546-0019 I KICK AGAINST CIVILIZATION WHICH MAKES LAWS REGARDLESS OF NATURE WHICH DELIBERATELY SHUTS ITS EYES TO ALL NATURAL TRUTHS IN REGARD TO THE RELATIONS OF MEN TO WOMEN AND IS THEREFORE FORCED TO CONTINUALLY WINK TO AVOID CONFESSING ITS FOLLY
5299-34546-0020 CIVILIZATION SEEMS TO ME TO HAVE DONE THE BEST IT COULD WITH A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM IT HAS NOT ACTUALLY ALLOWED DIFFERENT CODES OF MORALS TO MEN AND WOMEN AND IT MAY HAVE HAD TO WINK ON THAT ACCOUNT
5299-34546-0021 RIGHT THERE IN YOUR SCHOPENHAUER YOU HAVE A PRIMAL REASON THAT IS IF YOU CHOSE TO FOLLOW YOUR PHILOSOPHER TO THE EXTENT OF ACTUALLY BELIEVING THAT NATURE HAS DELIBERATELY FROM THE BEGINNING PROTECTED WOMEN AGAINST THAT SIN OF WHICH SO MUCH IS MADE
5299-34546-0022 I DO BELIEVE IT TRULY YOU ARE NO MORE CHARITABLE TOWARD MY SEX THAN MOST WOMEN ARE YET NEITHER YOUR TEACHER NOR YOU MAY BE RIGHT A THEORETIC ARGUER LIKE SCHOPENHAUER MAKES GOOD ENOUGH READING FOR CALM MINDS
5299-34546-0023 BUT HE IS BAD FOR AN EMOTIONAL TEMPERAMENT AND BY JOVE NAOMI HE WAS A BAD EXAMPLE OF HIS OWN PHILOSOPHY MY DEAR DICK I AM AFRAID I READ SCHOPENHAUER BECAUSE I THOUGHT WHAT HE WRITES LONG BEFORE I EVER HEARD OF HIM I READ HIM BECAUSE
5299-34546-0024 DID I NOT FIND A CLEAR LOGICAL MIND GOING THE SAME WAY MY MIND WILL GO I MIGHT BE TROUBLED WITH DOUBTS AND AFRAID THAT I WAS GOING QUITE WRONG WELL THE DEUCE AND ALL WITH A WOMAN WHEN SHE BEGINS TO READ STUFF LIKE THAT IS HER INABILITY TO GENERALIZE
5299-34546-0025 THE NATURAL COURSE OF YOUR LIFE COULD HARDLY HAVE PROVIDED YOU WITH THE PESSIMISM WITH WHICH I HOPE YOU WILL PARDON MY REMARK MY DEAR YOU HAVE TREATED ME SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS CHAMFORT AND SCHOPENHAUER DID THAT BUT THESE ARE NOT SUBJECTS A MAN DISCUSSES EASILY WITH HIS WIFE INDEED
5299-34546-0026 THEN THAT IS SURELY AN ERROR OF CIVILIZATION IF A MAN CAN DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS MORE EASILY WITH A WOMAN WHO IS NOT HIS WIFE IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO FRANKNESS IN MARRIAGE DICK DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT A MAN AND WOMAN STRONGLY ATTRACTED TOWARD ONE ANOTHER
5299-34546-0027 HOW EASILY YOU SAY THAT I HAVE HEARD THAT MOST WOMEN THINK THEY ARE NOT UNDERSTOOD BUT I NEVER REFLECTED ON THE MATTER YOU AND I HAVE NOT TROUBLED ONE ANOTHER MUCH WITH OUR DOUBTS AND PERPLEXITIES YOU AND I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY TOGETHER
5299-34546-0028 I HOPE THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE THE LAST TWO WORDS AS IF HE HAD EXPECTED HER TO ANTICIPATE THEM WITH SOMETHING AND THERE WAS A HALF INTERROGATIVE NOTE IN HIS VOICE SHE MADE NO RESPONSE SO HE WENT ON
5299-34546-0029 I KNOW I'VE NOT BEEN UNLOVING AND I HOPE YOU'VE NOT SUFFERED MANY DISCOMFORTS ON MY ACCOUNT I THINK AS WOMEN GO I AM FAIRLY REASONABLE OR I HAVE BEEN
5299-34546-0030 FOR SOME REASON SHATTUCK SEEMED TO FIND THE CIGAR HE WAS SMOKING MOST UNSATISFACTORY EITHER IT HAD BEEN BROKEN OR HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY CHEWED THE END A THING WHICH HE DETESTED AND THERE WAS A PAUSE WHILE HE DISCARDED THE WEED AND SELECTED A FRESH ONE
5299-34546-0031 HE APPEARED TO BE REFLECTING AS HE LIGHTED IT AND IF HIS MIND COULD HAVE BEEN READ IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS WONDERING HOW IT HAD HAPPENED THAT THE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN THIS TURN
5299-34546-0032 HE WAS CONSCIOUS ALL THE TIME THAT HIS WIFE WAS LOOKING RATHER STEADILY AT HIM AND HE KNEW THAT AT LEAST A CONVENTIONAL REPLY WAS EXPECTED OF HIM MY DEAR GIRL HE SAID I LOOK BACK ON TEN VERY SATISFACTORY YEARS OF MARRIED LIFE
5299-34546-0033 THAT MY WIFE HAS DEVELOPED RATHER SINGULAR TO SAY THE LEAST UNFLATTERING IDEAS OF LIFE
5299-34546-0034 THOUGH THEY ARE A BIT DISCONCERTING TO ME AS A HUSBAND I SUPPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT IS LOGICAL ENOUGH YOU WERE ALWAYS EVEN AS A GIRL INCLINED TO MAKING FOOTNOTES I SUPPOSE THEIR PRESENT DARING IS SIMPLY THE RESULT OF OUR BEING JUST A LITTLE OLDER THAN WE USED TO BE
5299-34546-0035 I SUPPOSE IF WE DID NOT OUTGROW OUR ILLUSIONS THE ROAD TO DEATH WOULD BE TOO TRAGIC FOR A MOMENT SHE MADE NO REPLY THEN AS IF FOR THE FIRST TIME OWNING TO THE IDEA WHICH HAD LONG BEEN UPPERMOST IN HER MIND SHE SAID SUDDENLY
5299-34546-0036 THAT I REALLY BELIEVE MARRIAGE IS FOOLISH I DO BELIEVE THAT NO MAN EVER APPROACHED IT WITHOUT REGRETTING THAT CIVILIZATION HAD MADE IT NECESSARY AND THAT MANY MEN WOULD ESCAPE AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT IF WOMEN DID NOT SO RIGIDLY HOLD THEM TO THEIR PROMISES
5299-34546-0037 AND IF BETWEEN TWO RIDICULOUS POSITIONS MARRIAGE HAVING BEEN PUSHED NEAREST HAD NOT BECOME DESPERATELY INEVITABLE
5299-34546-0038 CALMLY OR EAGERLY TO THEIR FATE EVERY DAY NEVERTHELESS I THINK THE PRE NUPTIAL CONFESSIONS OF A MAJORITY OF MEN OF OUR CLASS WOULD PROVE THAT WHAT I SAY IS TRUE ARE YOU HINTING THAT IT WAS TRUE IN YOUR CASE
5299-34546-0039 PERHAPS SHATTUCK GAVE AN AMUSED LAUGH DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU KEPT ME TO THE POINT NOT EXACTLY AT THAT TIME
5299-34546-0040 BESIDES A MAN DOES NOT OWN UP EVEN TO HIMSELF NOT ALWAYS WHEN HE FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH THE INEVITABLE
5299-34546-0041 BUT OF WHAT THEY FEEL OF THE FACT THAT IN TOO MANY INSTANCES NATURE NOT HAVING MEANT MEN FOR BONDAGE AFTER THEY HAVE PASSED THE RUBICON TO THAT SPOT FROM WHICH THE CODE OF CIVILIZED HONOR DOES NOT PERMIT THEM TO TURN BACK THEY USUALLY HAVE A PERIOD OF REGRET
5299-34546-0042 AND ARE FORCED TO MAKE A REAL EFFORT TO FACE THE FUTURE TO GO ON IN FACT THE SMILE HAD DIED OUT OF SHATTUCK'S FACE AND HE SAID QUITE SERIOUSLY AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED NAOMI I HAVE VERY DIFFERENT RECOLLECTIONS OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
5299-34546-0043 HAVE YOU AND YET MONTHS BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED I KNEW THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BROKEN YOUR HEART IF THE WEDDING HAD NOT COME OFF AT ALL MY DEAR THE MODERN HEART DOES NOT BREAK EASILY IN THIS AGE WE ARE SCHOOLED TO MEET THE ACCIDENTS OF LIFE WITH SOME PHILOSOPHY AND YET
5299-34546-0044 TO HAVE LOST YOU THEN WOULD HAVE KILLED ME SHATTUCK LOOKED AT HER SHARPLY WITH ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE SAID A NEW INTEREST BUT SHE WAS NO LONGER LOOKING AT HIM SHE WENT ON HURRIEDLY YOU LOVED ME OF COURSE I WAS OF YOUR WORLD
5299-34546-0045 I WAS A WOMAN THAT OTHER MEN LIKED AND THEREFORE A DESIRABLE WOMAN I WAS OF GOOD FAMILY ALTOGETHER YOUR SOCIAL EQUAL IN FACT QUITE THE SORT OF WOMAN IT BECAME YOU TO MARRY I PLEASED YOU AND I LOVED YOU
5299-34546-0046 IN TEN YEARS I DOUBT IF YOU HAVE EVER MADE SO FRANK A DECLARATION AS THAT IN WORDS HE WAS WONDERING IF AFTER ALL SHE WERE GOING TO DEVELOP INTO AN EMOTIONAL WOMAN
5299-34546-0047 THINGS ARE SO MUCH HARDER
5299-34546-0048 SHE WENT ON FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMUNITY PERHAPS STILL IT IS NOT ALWAYS PLEASANT TO BE A WOMAN AND YET THINK A WOMAN WHOSE REASON HAS BEEN MISTAKENLY DEVELOPED AT THE EXPENSE OF HER CAPACITY TO ENJOY BEING A WOMAN
5299-34546-0049 AND WHO IS FORCED AT THE SAME TIME TO ENCOUNTER THE LAWS OF NATURE AND PAY AT THE SAME TIME THE PENALTY OF BEING A WOMAN AND THE PENALTY OF KNOWLEDGE FOR JUST SO SURELY AS WE LIVE WE MUST ENCOUNTER LOVE
5299-34546-0050 YOU MIGHT TAKE IT OUT INTERRUPTED THE HUSBAND IN FEELING FLATTERED THAT IT TAKES SO MUCH TO CONQUER SUCH AS YOU SO WE MIGHT BUT THAT ONCE CONQUERED NEITHER MAN NOR NATURE HAS ANY FURTHER USE FOR US AND REGRET LIKE ART IS LONG
5299-34546-0051 THAT LIFE IS VERY UNFAIR TO WOMEN WELL I DON'T SEE THAT
5299-34546-0052 I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER THEM LOVE ITSELF IS HARD ON A WOMAN IT SEEMS TO STIR A MAN'S FACULTIES HEALTHILY
5299-34546-0053 IT DOES NOT SEEM TO UPROOT A MAN'S WHOLE BEING DOES IT SERVE WOMEN IN THAT WAY I BEAR WITNESS THAT IT MAKES SOME OF YOU DEUCEDLY HANDSOME AND I HAVE HEARD THAT IT MAKES SOME OF YOU GOOD YES AS CHASTISEMENT DOES
5299-34546-0054 VERY UNJUSTLY AND YET AS THIS LIFE IS THE ONLY ONE WE KNOW WE MUST ADJUST OURSELVES TO IT AS WE FIND IT NO NO WE HAD BETTER HAVE ACCEPTED THE THING AS NATURE GAVE IT TO US
5299-34546-0055 WE CAME INTO THIS WORLD LIKE BEASTS WHY AREN'T WE CONTENT TO LIVE LIKE BEASTS AND MAKE NO PRETENSES WOMEN WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPECT THEN AND THERE'D BE NO SUCH THING AS BROKEN HEARTS IN SPITE OF ALL THE POLISH OF CIVILIZATION MAN IS SIMPLY BENT ON CONQUEST
5299-34546-0056 WOMAN IS ONLY ONE PHASE OF THE CHASE TO HIM A CHASE IN WHICH EVERY ACTIVE VIRILE MAN IS OCCUPIED FROM HIS CRADLE TO HIS GRAVE YOU ARE THE CONQUERORS WE ARE SIMPLY THE CONQUERED SHATTUCK TRIED TO MAKE HIS VOICE LIGHT AS HE SAID
5299-34546-0057 NOT ALWAYS UNHAPPY ONES I FANCY I SUPPOSE ALL MEN FLATTER THEMSELVES THAT WAY AND ARGUE THAT PROBABLY THE SABINE WOMEN PREFERRED THEIR FATE TO NO FATE AT ALL
