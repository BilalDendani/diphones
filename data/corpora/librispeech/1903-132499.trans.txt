1903-132499-0050 HE DID NOT WANT TO MEET ANYONE TILL THEN GOING UP THE STAIRS HE NOTICED THAT NASTASYA RUSHED FROM THE SAMOVAR TO WATCH HIM INTENTLY CAN ANYONE HAVE COME TO SEE ME HE WONDERED
1903-132499-0051 HE HAD A DISGUSTED VISION OF PORFIRY BUT OPENING HIS DOOR HE SAW DOUNIA SHE WAS SITTING ALONE PLUNGED IN DEEP THOUGHT AND LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME
1903-132499-0052 HE STOPPED SHORT IN THE DOORWAY SHE ROSE FROM THE SOFA IN DISMAY AND STOOD UP FACING HIM HER EYES FIXED UPON HIM BETRAYED HORROR AND INFINITE GRIEF
1903-132499-0053 AND FROM THOSE EYES ALONE HE SAW AT ONCE THAT SHE KNEW AM I TO COME IN OR GO AWAY HE ASKED UNCERTAINLY

1903-132499-0055 I FEEL WEAK DOUNIA I AM VERY TIRED AND I SHOULD HAVE LIKED AT THIS MOMENT TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL MYSELF HE GLANCED AT HER MISTRUSTFULLY
1903-132499-0056 WHERE WERE YOU ALL NIGHT I DON'T REMEMBER CLEARLY YOU SEE SISTER I WANTED TO MAKE UP MY MIND ONCE FOR ALL AND SEVERAL TIMES I WALKED BY THE NEVA I REMEMBER THAT I WANTED TO END IT ALL THERE BUT

1903-132499-0061 I AM SURE SHE HALF UNDERSTANDS IT ALREADY PERHAPS I DID WRONG IN GOING TO SEE HER I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID GO
1903-132499-0062 A CONTEMPTIBLE PERSON BUT READY TO FACE SUFFERING YOU ARE AREN'T YOU YES I AM GOING AT ONCE YES
1903-132499-0063 TO ESCAPE THE DISGRACE I THOUGHT OF DROWNING MYSELF DOUNIA BUT AS I LOOKED INTO THE WATER I THOUGHT THAT IF I HAD CONSIDERED MYSELF STRONG TILL NOW I'D BETTER NOT BE AFRAID OF DISGRACE HE SAID HURRYING ON
1903-132499-0064 PRIDE RODYA THERE WAS A GLEAM OF FIRE IN HIS LUSTRELESS EYES HE SEEMED TO BE GLAD TO THINK THAT HE WAS STILL PROUD
1903-132499-0065 YOU DON'T THINK SISTER THAT I WAS SIMPLY AFRAID OF THE WATER HE ASKED LOOKING INTO HER FACE WITH A SINISTER SMILE OH RODYA HUSH
1903-132499-0066 CRIED DOUNIA BITTERLY SILENCE LASTED FOR TWO MINUTES HE SAT WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE FLOOR DOUNIA STOOD AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH ANGUISH
1903-132499-0067 SUDDENLY HE GOT UP IT'S LATE IT'S TIME TO GO I AM GOING AT ONCE TO GIVE MYSELF UP
1903-132499-0068 BIG TEARS FELL DOWN HER CHEEKS YOU ARE CRYING SISTER BUT CAN YOU HOLD OUT YOUR HAND TO ME YOU DOUBTED IT SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIM
1903-132499-0069 AREN'T YOU HALF EXPIATING YOUR CRIME BY FACING THE SUFFERING SHE CRIED HOLDING HIM CLOSE AND KISSING HIM CRIME WHAT CRIME HE CRIED IN SUDDEN FURY
1903-132499-0070 THAT I KILLED A VILE NOXIOUS INSECT AN OLD PAWNBROKER WOMAN OF USE TO NO ONE KILLING HER WAS ATONEMENT FOR FORTY SINS SHE WAS SUCKING THE LIFE OUT OF POOR PEOPLE WAS THAT A CRIME
1903-132499-0071 ONLY NOW I SEE CLEARLY THE IMBECILITY OF MY COWARDICE NOW THAT I HAVE DECIDED TO FACE THIS SUPERFLUOUS DISGRACE IT'S SIMPLY BECAUSE I AM CONTEMPTIBLE AND HAVE NOTHING IN ME THAT I HAVE DECIDED TO PERHAPS TOO FOR MY ADVANTAGE AS THAT
1903-132499-0072 PORFIRY SUGGESTED BROTHER BROTHER WHAT ARE YOU SAYING WHY YOU HAVE SHED BLOOD CRIED DOUNIA IN DESPAIR WHICH ALL MEN SHED HE PUT IN ALMOST FRANTICALLY
1903-132499-0073 WHICH FLOWS AND HAS ALWAYS FLOWED IN STREAMS WHICH IS SPILT LIKE CHAMPAGNE AND FOR WHICH MEN ARE CROWNED IN THE CAPITOL AND ARE CALLED AFTERWARDS BENEFACTORS OF MANKIND LOOK INTO IT MORE CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND IT
1903-132499-0074 I TOO WANTED TO DO GOOD TO MEN AND WOULD HAVE DONE HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF GOOD DEEDS TO MAKE UP FOR THAT ONE PIECE OF STUPIDITY NOT STUPIDITY EVEN SIMPLY CLUMSINESS
1903-132499-0075 FOR THE IDEA WAS BY NO MEANS SO STUPID AS IT SEEMS NOW THAT IT HAS FAILED EVERYTHING SEEMS STUPID WHEN IT FAILS BY THAT STUPIDITY I ONLY WANTED TO PUT MYSELF INTO AN INDEPENDENT POSITION
1903-132499-0076 TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP TO OBTAIN MEANS AND THEN EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN SMOOTHED OVER BY BENEFITS IMMEASURABLE IN COMPARISON BUT I I COULDN'T CARRY OUT EVEN THE FIRST STEP BECAUSE I AM CONTEMPTIBLE
1903-132499-0077 THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER AND YET I WON'T LOOK AT IT AS YOU DO IF I HAD SUCCEEDED I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CROWNED WITH GLORY BUT NOW I'M TRAPPED BUT THAT'S NOT SO NOT SO
1903-132499-0078 BROTHER WHAT ARE YOU SAYING AH IT'S NOT PICTURESQUE NOT AESTHETICALLY ATTRACTIVE I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHY BOMBARDING PEOPLE BY REGULAR SIEGE IS MORE HONOURABLE
1903-132499-0079 I'VE NEVER NEVER RECOGNISED THIS MORE CLEARLY THAN NOW AND I AM FURTHER THAN EVER FROM SEEING THAT WHAT I DID WAS A CRIME I'VE NEVER NEVER BEEN STRONGER AND MORE CONVINCED THAN NOW
1903-132499-0080 BUT AS HE UTTERED HIS LAST EXPLANATION
1903-132499-0081 AND HE SAW SUCH ANGUISH IN THEM THAT HE COULD NOT HELP BEING CHECKED HE FELT THAT HE HAD ANYWAY MADE THESE TWO POOR WOMEN MISERABLE THAT HE WAS ANYWAY THE CAUSE
1903-132499-0082 DOUNIA DARLING IF I AM GUILTY FORGIVE ME THOUGH I CANNOT BE FORGIVEN IF I AM GUILTY GOOD BYE WE WON'T DISPUTE IT'S TIME HIGH TIME TO GO

1903-132499-0086 GOOD BYE FOR THE PRESENT HE CONCLUDED HURRIEDLY NOTICING AGAIN A STRANGE EXPRESSION IN DOUNIA'S EYES AT HIS LAST WORDS AND PROMISES WHY ARE YOU CRYING DON'T CRY DON'T CRY WE ARE NOT PARTING FOR EVER
1903-132499-0087 HE WENT TO THE TABLE TOOK UP A THICK DUSTY BOOK
1903-132499-0088 IT WAS THE PORTRAIT OF HIS LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER WHO HAD DIED OF FEVER THAT STRANGE GIRL WHO HAD WANTED TO BE A NUN FOR A MINUTE HE GAZED AT THE DELICATE EXPRESSIVE FACE OF HIS BETROTHED
1903-132499-0089 KISSED THE PORTRAIT AND GAVE IT TO DOUNIA I USED TO TALK A GREAT DEAL ABOUT IT TO HER ONLY TO HER HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY
1903-132499-0090 TO HER HEART I CONFIDED MUCH OF WHAT HAS SINCE BEEN SO HIDEOUSLY REALISED DON'T BE UNEASY
1903-132499-0091 SHE WAS AS MUCH OPPOSED TO IT AS YOU AND I AM GLAD THAT SHE IS GONE THE GREAT POINT IS THAT EVERYTHING NOW IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT IS GOING TO BE BROKEN IN TWO HE CRIED SUDDENLY RETURNING TO HIS DEJECTION
1903-132499-0092 EVERYTHING EVERYTHING AND AM I PREPARED FOR IT DO I WANT IT MYSELF THEY SAY IT IS NECESSARY FOR ME TO SUFFER WHAT'S THE OBJECT OF THESE SENSELESS SUFFERINGS
1903-132499-0093 SHALL I KNOW ANY BETTER WHAT THEY ARE FOR WHEN I AM CRUSHED BY HARDSHIPS AND IDIOCY AND WEAK AS AN OLD MAN AFTER TWENTY YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE AND WHAT SHALL I HAVE TO LIVE FOR THEN
1903-132499-0094 WHY AM I CONSENTING TO THAT LIFE NOW OH I KNEW I WAS CONTEMPTIBLE WHEN I STOOD LOOKING AT THE NEVA AT DAYBREAK TO DAY AT LAST THEY BOTH WENT OUT
1903-132499-0095 IT WAS HARD FOR DOUNIA BUT SHE LOVED HIM SHE WALKED AWAY BUT AFTER GOING FIFTY PACES SHE TURNED ROUND TO LOOK AT HIM AGAIN HE WAS STILL IN SIGHT AT THE CORNER
1903-132499-0096 HE TOO TURNED AND FOR THE LAST TIME THEIR EYES MET BUT NOTICING THAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT HIM HE MOTIONED HER AWAY WITH IMPATIENCE AND EVEN VEXATION AND TURNED THE CORNER ABRUPTLY
1903-132499-0097 I AM WICKED I SEE THAT
1903-132499-0098 BUT WHY ARE THEY SO FOND OF ME IF I DON'T DESERVE IT OH IF ONLY I WERE ALONE AND NO ONE LOVED ME AND I TOO HAD NEVER LOVED ANYONE NOTHING OF ALL THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
1903-132499-0099 BUT I WONDER SHALL I IN THOSE FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS GROW SO MEEK THAT I SHALL HUMBLE MYSELF BEFORE PEOPLE AND WHIMPER AT EVERY WORD THAT I AM A CRIMINAL
1903-132499-0100 YES THAT'S IT THAT'S IT THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE SENDING ME THERE FOR THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT LOOK AT THEM RUNNING TO AND FRO ABOUT THE STREETS EVERY ONE OF THEM A SCOUNDREL AND A CRIMINAL AT HEART AND WORSE STILL AN IDIOT
1903-132499-0101 BUT TRY TO GET ME OFF AND THEY'D BE WILD WITH RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION OH HOW I HATE THEM ALL HE FELL TO MUSING BY WHAT PROCESS IT COULD COME TO PASS
1903-132499-0102 THAT HE COULD BE HUMBLED BEFORE ALL OF THEM INDISCRIMINATELY HUMBLED BY CONVICTION AND YET WHY NOT IT MUST BE SO
1903-132499-0103 WOULD NOT TWENTY YEARS OF CONTINUAL BONDAGE CRUSH HIM UTTERLY WATER WEARS OUT A STONE AND WHY WHY SHOULD HE LIVE AFTER THAT
1903-132499-0104 WHY SHOULD HE GO NOW WHEN HE KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE SO IT WAS THE HUNDREDTH TIME PERHAPS THAT HE HAD ASKED HIMSELF THAT QUESTION SINCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING BUT STILL
