3433-135988-0000 AND BECAUSE HE FOUND ALL THE OTHER SUBURBS OF DUBLIN MEAN MODERN AND PRETENTIOUS HE LIVED IN AN OLD SOMBRE HOUSE AND FROM HIS WINDOWS HE COULD LOOK INTO THE DISUSED DISTILLERY OR UPWARDS ALONG THE SHALLOW RIVER ON WHICH DUBLIN IS BUILT
3433-135988-0001 THE LOFTY WALLS OF HIS UNCARPETED ROOM WERE FREE FROM PICTURES HE HAD HIMSELF BOUGHT EVERY ARTICLE OF FURNITURE IN THE ROOM A BLACK IRON BEDSTEAD AN IRON WASHSTAND FOUR CANE CHAIRS A CLOTHES RACK
3433-135988-0002 A COAL SCUTTLE A FENDER AND IRONS AND A SQUARE TABLE ON WHICH LAY A DOUBLE DESK A BOOKCASE HAD BEEN MADE IN AN ALCOVE BY MEANS OF SHELVES OF WHITE WOOD THE BED WAS CLOTHED WITH WHITE BEDCLOTHES AND A BLACK AND SCARLET RUG COVERED THE FOOT
3433-135988-0003 A LITTLE HAND MIRROR HUNG ABOVE THE WASHSTAND AND DURING THE DAY A WHITE SHADED LAMP STOOD AS THE SOLE ORNAMENT OF THE MANTELPIECE THE BOOKS ON THE WHITE WOODEN SHELVES WERE ARRANGED FROM BELOW UPWARDS ACCORDING TO BULK
3433-135988-0004 A COMPLETE WORDSWORTH STOOD AT ONE END OF THE LOWEST SHELF AND A COPY OF THE MAYNOOTH CATECHISM SEWN INTO THE CLOTH COVER OF A NOTEBOOK STOOD AT ONE END OF THE TOP SHELF WRITING MATERIALS WERE ALWAYS ON THE DESK
3433-135988-0005 IN THE DESK LAY A MANUSCRIPT TRANSLATION OF HAUPTMANN'S MICHAEL KRAMER THE STAGE DIRECTIONS OF WHICH WERE WRITTEN IN PURPLE INK AND A LITTLE SHEAF OF PAPERS HELD TOGETHER BY A BRASS PIN IN THESE SHEETS A SENTENCE WAS INSCRIBED FROM TIME TO TIME
3433-135988-0006 AND IN AN IRONICAL MOMENT THE HEADLINE OF AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR BILE BEANS HAD BEEN PASTED ON TO THE FIRST SHEET ON LIFTING THE LID OF THE DESK A FAINT FRAGRANCE ESCAPED THE FRAGRANCE OF NEW CEDARWOOD PENCILS OR OF A BOTTLE OF GUM
3433-135988-0007 OR OF AN OVERRIPE APPLE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEFT THERE AND FORGOTTEN MISTER DUFFY ABHORRED ANYTHING WHICH BETOKENED PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISORDER A MEDIAEVAL DOCTOR WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM SATURNINE
3433-135988-0008 HIS FACE WHICH CARRIED THE ENTIRE TALE OF HIS YEARS WAS OF THE BROWN TINT OF DUBLIN STREETS ON HIS LONG AND RATHER LARGE HEAD GREW DRY BLACK HAIR AND A TAWNY MOUSTACHE DID NOT QUITE COVER AN UNAMIABLE MOUTH
3433-135988-0009 HIS CHEEKBONES ALSO GAVE HIS FACE A HARSH CHARACTER BUT THERE WAS NO HARSHNESS IN THE EYES WHICH LOOKING AT THE WORLD FROM UNDER THEIR TAWNY EYEBROWS GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF A MAN EVER ALERT TO GREET A REDEEMING INSTINCT IN OTHERS
3433-135988-0010 BUT OFTEN DISAPPOINTED HE LIVED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM HIS BODY REGARDING HIS OWN ACTS WITH DOUBTFUL SIDE GLANCES HE HAD AN ODD AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL HABIT WHICH LED HIM TO COMPOSE IN HIS MIND FROM TIME TO TIME
3433-135988-0011 A SHORT SENTENCE ABOUT HIMSELF CONTAINING A SUBJECT IN THE THIRD PERSON AND A PREDICATE IN THE PAST TENSE HE NEVER GAVE ALMS TO BEGGARS AND WALKED FIRMLY CARRYING A STOUT HAZEL
3433-135988-0012 HE HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS CASHIER OF A PRIVATE BANK IN BAGGOT STREET EVERY MORNING HE CAME IN FROM CHAPELIZOD BY TRAM AT MIDDAY HE WENT TO DAN BURKE'S AND TOOK HIS LUNCH A BOTTLE OF LAGER BEER AND A SMALL TRAYFUL OF ARROWROOT BISCUITS
3433-135988-0013 AT FOUR O'CLOCK HE WAS SET FREE HE DINED IN AN EATING HOUSE IN GEORGE'S STREET WHERE HE FELT HIMSELF SAFE FROM THE SOCIETY OF DUBLIN'S GILDED YOUTH AND WHERE THERE WAS A CERTAIN PLAIN HONESTY IN THE BILL OF FARE
3433-135988-0014 THESE WERE THE ONLY DISSIPATIONS OF HIS LIFE HE HAD NEITHER COMPANIONS NOR FRIENDS CHURCH NOR CREED HE LIVED HIS SPIRITUAL LIFE WITHOUT ANY COMMUNION WITH OTHERS VISITING HIS RELATIVES AT CHRISTMAS
3433-135988-0015 AND ESCORTING THEM TO THE CEMETERY WHEN THEY DIED HE PERFORMED THESE TWO SOCIAL DUTIES FOR OLD DIGNITY'S SAKE BUT CONCEDED NOTHING FURTHER TO THE CONVENTIONS WHICH REGULATE THE CIVIC LIFE
3433-135988-0016 BUT AS THESE CIRCUMSTANCES NEVER AROSE HIS LIFE ROLLED OUT EVENLY AN ADVENTURELESS TALE ONE EVENING HE FOUND HIMSELF SITTING BESIDE TWO LADIES IN THE ROTUNDA THE HOUSE THINLY PEOPLED AND SILENT
3433-135988-0017 GAVE DISTRESSING PROPHECY OF FAILURE THE LADY WHO SAT NEXT HIM LOOKED ROUND AT THE DESERTED HOUSE ONCE OR TWICE AND THEN SAID WHAT A PITY THERE IS SUCH A POOR HOUSE TONIGHT IT'S SO HARD ON PEOPLE TO HAVE TO SING TO EMPTY BENCHES
3433-135988-0018 HE TOOK THE REMARK AS AN INVITATION TO TALK HE WAS SURPRISED THAT SHE SEEMED SO LITTLE AWKWARD WHILE THEY TALKED HE TRIED TO FIX HER PERMANENTLY IN HIS MEMORY WHEN HE LEARNED THAT THE YOUNG GIRL BESIDE HER WAS HER DAUGHTER
3433-135988-0019 HE JUDGED HER TO BE A YEAR OR SO YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF HER FACE WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN HANDSOME HAD REMAINED INTELLIGENT IT WAS AN OVAL FACE WITH STRONGLY MARKED FEATURES THE EYES WERE VERY DARK BLUE AND STEADY
3433-135988-0020 THEIR GAZE BEGAN WITH A DEFIANT NOTE BUT WAS CONFUSED BY WHAT SEEMED A DELIBERATE SWOON OF THE PUPIL INTO THE IRIS REVEALING FOR AN INSTANT A TEMPERAMENT OF GREAT SENSIBILITY THE PUPIL REASSERTED ITSELF QUICKLY
3433-135988-0021 THIS HALF DISCLOSED NATURE FELL AGAIN UNDER THE REIGN OF PRUDENCE AND HER ASTRAKHAN JACKET MOULDING A BOSOM OF A CERTAIN FULLNESS STRUCK THE NOTE OF DEFIANCE MORE DEFINITELY HE MET HER AGAIN A FEW WEEKS AFTERWARDS AT A CONCERT IN EARLSFORT TERRACE
3433-135988-0022 AND SEIZED THE MOMENTS WHEN HER DAUGHTER'S ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED TO BECOME INTIMATE SHE ALLUDED ONCE OR TWICE TO HER HUSBAND BUT HER TONE WAS NOT SUCH AS TO MAKE THE ALLUSION A WARNING HER NAME WAS MISSUS SINICO
3433-135988-0023 HER HUSBAND'S GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD COME FROM LEGHORN HER HUSBAND WAS CAPTAIN OF A MERCANTILE BOAT PLYING BETWEEN DUBLIN AND HOLLAND AND THEY HAD ONE CHILD MEETING HER A THIRD TIME BY ACCIDENT HE FOUND COURAGE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
3433-135988-0024 SHE CAME THIS WAS THE FIRST OF MANY MEETINGS THEY MET ALWAYS IN THE EVENING AND CHOSE THE MOST QUIET QUARTERS FOR THEIR WALKS TOGETHER MISTER DUFFY HOWEVER HAD A DISTASTE FOR UNDERHAND WAYS
3433-135988-0025 AND FINDING THAT THEY WERE COMPELLED TO MEET STEALTHILY HE FORCED HER TO ASK HIM TO HER HOUSE CAPTAIN SINICO ENCOURAGED HIS VISITS THINKING THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND WAS IN QUESTION HE HAD DISMISSED HIS WIFE SO SINCERELY FROM HIS GALLERY OF PLEASURES
3433-135988-0026 THAT HE DID NOT SUSPECT THAT ANYONE ELSE WOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN HER AS THE HUSBAND WAS OFTEN AWAY AND THE DAUGHTER OUT GIVING MUSIC LESSONS MISTER DUFFY HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES OF ENJOYING THE LADY'S SOCIETY
3433-135988-0027 NEITHER HE NOR SHE HAD HAD ANY SUCH ADVENTURE BEFORE AND NEITHER WAS CONSCIOUS OF ANY INCONGRUITY
3433-135988-0028 HE ENTANGLED HIS THOUGHTS WITH HERS HE LENT HER BOOKS PROVIDED HER WITH IDEAS SHARED HIS INTELLECTUAL LIFE WITH HER SHE LISTENED TO ALL SOMETIMES IN RETURN FOR HIS THEORIES SHE GAVE OUT SOME FACT OF HER OWN LIFE
3433-135988-0029 WITH ALMOST MATERNAL SOLICITUDE SHE URGED HIM TO LET HIS NATURE OPEN TO THE FULL SHE BECAME HIS CONFESSOR HE TOLD HER THAT FOR SOME TIME HE HAD ASSISTED AT THE MEETINGS OF AN IRISH SOCIALIST PARTY
3433-135988-0030 WHERE HE HAD FELT HIMSELF A UNIQUE FIGURE AMIDST A SCORE OF SOBER WORKMEN IN A GARRET LIT BY AN INEFFICIENT OIL LAMP WHEN THE PARTY HAD DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS EACH UNDER ITS OWN LEADER AND IN ITS OWN GARRET HE HAD DISCONTINUED HIS ATTENDANCES
3433-135988-0031 THE WORKMEN'S DISCUSSIONS HE SAID WERE TOO TIMOROUS THE INTEREST THEY TOOK IN THE QUESTION OF WAGES WAS INORDINATE HE FELT THAT THEY WERE HARD FEATURED REALISTS AND THAT THEY RESENTED AN EXACTITUDE WHICH WAS THE PRODUCE OF A LEISURE NOT WITHIN THEIR REACH
3433-135988-0032 TO COMPETE WITH PHRASEMONGERS INCAPABLE OF THINKING CONSECUTIVELY FOR SIXTY SECONDS TO SUBMIT HIMSELF TO THE CRITICISMS OF AN OBTUSE MIDDLE CLASS WHICH ENTRUSTED ITS MORALITY TO POLICEMEN AND ITS FINE ARTS TO IMPRESARIOS
3433-135988-0033 HE WENT OFTEN TO HER LITTLE COTTAGE OUTSIDE DUBLIN OFTEN THEY SPENT THEIR EVENINGS ALONE LITTLE BY LITTLE AS THEIR THOUGHTS ENTANGLED THEY SPOKE OF SUBJECTS LESS REMOTE
3433-135988-0034 HER COMPANIONSHIP WAS LIKE A WARM SOIL ABOUT AN EXOTIC MANY TIMES SHE ALLOWED THE DARK TO FALL UPON THEM REFRAINING FROM LIGHTING THE LAMP THE DARK DISCREET ROOM THEIR ISOLATION
3433-135988-0035 THE MUSIC THAT STILL VIBRATED IN THEIR EARS UNITED THEM THIS UNION EXALTED HIM WORE AWAY THE ROUGH EDGES OF HIS CHARACTER EMOTIONALISED HIS MENTAL LIFE SOMETIMES HE CAUGHT HIMSELF LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE
3433-135988-0036 INSISTING ON THE SOUL'S INCURABLE LONELINESS WE CANNOT GIVE OURSELVES IT SAID WE ARE OUR OWN THE END OF THESE DISCOURSES WAS THAT ONE NIGHT DURING WHICH SHE HAD SHOWN EVERY SIGN OF UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT
3433-135988-0037 AS HE DID NOT WISH THEIR LAST INTERVIEW TO BE TROUBLED BY THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR RUINED CONFESSIONAL THEY MET IN A LITTLE CAKESHOP NEAR THE PARKGATE IT WAS COLD AUTUMN WEATHER BUT IN SPITE OF THE COLD THEY WANDERED UP AND DOWN THE ROADS OF THE PARK FOR NEARLY THREE HOURS
3433-135988-0038 THEY AGREED TO BREAK OFF THEIR INTERCOURSE EVERY BOND HE SAID IS A BOND TO SORROW WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF THE PARK THEY WALKED IN SILENCE TOWARDS THE TRAM BUT HERE SHE BEGAN TO TREMBLE SO VIOLENTLY
3433-135988-0039 THAT FEARING ANOTHER COLLAPSE ON HER PART HE BADE HER GOOD BYE QUICKLY AND LEFT HER A FEW DAYS LATER HE RECEIVED A PARCEL CONTAINING HIS BOOKS AND MUSIC FOUR YEARS PASSED MISTER DUFFY RETURNED TO HIS EVEN WAY OF LIFE
3433-135988-0040 HIS ROOM STILL BORE WITNESS OF THE ORDERLINESS OF HIS MIND SOME NEW PIECES OF MUSIC ENCUMBERED THE MUSIC STAND IN THE LOWER ROOM AND ON HIS SHELVES STOOD TWO VOLUMES BY NIETZSCHE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND THE GAY SCIENCE
3433-135988-0041 HE WROTE SELDOM IN THE SHEAF OF PAPERS WHICH LAY IN HIS DESK ONE OF HIS SENTENCES WRITTEN TWO MONTHS AFTER HIS LAST INTERVIEW WITH MISSUS SINICO READ LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE MUST NOT BE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE
3433-135988-0042 AND FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE MUST BE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE HE KEPT AWAY FROM CONCERTS LEST HE SHOULD MEET HER
