2050-164335-0000 CONTINUES ROULETABILLE'S NOTE BOOK WE WERE NEAR HER DOOR IN THE GALLERY WHERE THIS INCREDIBLE PHENOMENON HAD TAKEN PLACE THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN ONE FEELS AS IF ONE'S BRAIN WERE ABOUT TO BURST A BULLET IN THE HEAD
2050-164335-0001 A FRACTURE OF THE SKULL THE SEAT OF REASON SHATTERED WITH ONLY THESE CAN I COMPARE THE SENSATION WHICH EXHAUSTED AND LEFT ME VOID OF SENSE HAPPILY MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD OF HER ANTE ROOM
2050-164335-0002 I SAW HER AND THAT HELPED TO RELIEVE MY CHAOTIC STATE OF MIND I BREATHED HER I INHALED THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK WHOM I SHOULD NEVER SEE AGAIN
2050-164335-0003 ALAS I NO MORE MEET HER BUT FROM TIME TO TIME AND YET AND YET HOW THE MEMORY OF THAT PERFUME FELT BY ME ALONE CARRIES ME BACK TO THE DAYS OF MY CHILDHOOD
2050-164335-0004 IT WAS THIS SHARP REMINDER FROM MY BELOVED PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK WHICH MADE ME GO TO HER DRESSED WHOLLY IN WHITE AND SO PALE SO PALE AND SO BEAUTIFUL ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE INEXPLICABLE GALLERY HER BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HAIR
2050-164335-0005 GATHERED INTO A KNOT ON THE BACK OF HER NECK LEFT VISIBLE THE RED STAR ON HER TEMPLE WHICH HAD SO NEARLY BEEN THE CAUSE OF HER DEATH WHEN I FIRST GOT ON THE RIGHT TRACK OF THE MYSTERY OF THIS CASE I HAD IMAGINED THAT ON THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY IN THE YELLOW ROOM
2050-164335-0006 MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON HAD WORN HER HAIR IN BANDS BUT THEN HOW COULD I HAVE IMAGINED OTHERWISE WHEN I HAD NOT BEEN IN THE YELLOW ROOM WHEN I WROTE THESE LINES JOSEPH ROULETABILLE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND HE SPOKE OF HIS YOUTH
2050-164335-0007 IT IS NOT MY FAULT IF IN THE DOCUMENT WHICH I HAVE CITED ROULETABILLE THOUGHT FIT TO REFER TO HIS CHILDHOOD BUT NOW SINCE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INEXPLICABLE GALLERY I DID NOT REASON AT ALL I STOOD THERE
2050-164335-0008 STUPID BEFORE THE APPARITION SO PALE AND SO BEAUTIFUL OF MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON SHE WAS CLAD IN A DRESSING GOWN OF DREAMY WHITE ONE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HER TO BE A GHOST A LOVELY PHANTOM
2050-164335-0009 HER FATHER TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HER PASSIONATELY AS IF HE HAD RECOVERED HER AFTER BEING LONG LOST TO HIM
2050-164335-0010 THE DOOR OF THE BOUDOIR WAS OPEN THE TERRIFIED FACES OF THE TWO NURSES CRANED TOWARDS US MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON INQUIRED THE MEANING OF ALL THE DISTURBANCE THAT SHE WAS NOT IN HER OWN ROOM WAS QUITE EASILY EXPLAINED QUITE EASILY
2050-164335-0011 SHE HAD A FANCY NOT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT IN HER CHAMBER BUT IN THE BOUDOIR WITH HER NURSES
2050-164335-0012 SINCE THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME SHE HAD EXPERIENCED FEELINGS OF TERROR AND FEARS CAME OVER HER THAT ARE EASILY TO BE COMPREHENDED BUT WHO COULD IMAGINE THAT ON THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT WHEN HE WAS TO COME SHE WOULD BY A MERE CHANCE DETERMINE TO SHUT HERSELF IN WITH HER WOMEN
2050-164335-0013 HE WHO COULD UNDERSTAND ALL THIS WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME THAT MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON KNEW THAT THE MURDERER WAS COMING SHE COULD NOT PREVENT HIS COMING AGAIN UNKNOWN TO HER FATHER UNKNOWN TO ALL BUT TO MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC FOR HE MUST KNOW IT NOW PERHAPS HE HAD KNOWN IT BEFORE
2050-164335-0014 DID HE REMEMBER THAT PHRASE IN THE ELYSEE GARDEN MUST I COMMIT A CRIME THEN TO WIN YOU AGAINST WHOM THE CRIME IF NOT AGAINST THE OBSTACLE AGAINST THE MURDERER AH I WOULD KILL HIM WITH MY OWN HAND
2050-164335-0015 AND I REPLIED YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION THAT WAS THE VERY TRUTH IN TRUTH IN TRUTH MONSIEUR DARZAC KNEW THE MURDERER SO WELL THAT WHILE WISHING TO KILL HIM HIMSELF HE WAS AFRAID I SHOULD FIND HIM
2050-164335-0016 THERE COULD BE BUT TWO REASONS WHY HE HAD ASSISTED ME IN MY INVESTIGATION FIRST BECAUSE I FORCED HIM TO DO IT AND SECOND BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE THE BETTER PROTECTED I AM IN THE CHAMBER HER ROOM I LOOK AT HER
2050-164335-0017 SHE HAS POSSESSED HERSELF OF IT IT WAS EVIDENTLY INTENDED FOR HER EVIDENTLY HOW SHE TREMBLES TREMBLES AT THE STRANGE STORY HER FATHER IS TELLING HER OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MURDERER IN HER CHAMBER AND OF THE PURSUIT
2050-164335-0018 BY SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE MEANS HAD BEEN ABLE TO ELUDE US THEN FOLLOWS A SILENCE WHAT A SILENCE WE ARE ALL THERE LOOKING AT HER HER FATHER LARSAN DADDY JACQUES AND I
2050-164335-0019 WHAT WERE WE ALL THINKING OF IN THE SILENCE AFTER THE EVENTS OF THAT NIGHT OF THE MYSTERY OF THE INEXPLICABLE GALLERY
2050-164335-0020 FOR HERSELF AND FROM THE OTHER IT BROUGHT THE TEARS TO MY EYES SHE IS THERE SHEDDING ABOUT HER THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK AT LAST I SEE HER IN THE SILENCE OF HER CHAMBER
2050-164335-0021 SINCE THE FATAL HOUR OF THE MYSTERY OF THE YELLOW ROOM WE HAVE HUNG ABOUT THIS INVISIBLE AND SILENT WOMAN TO LEARN WHAT SHE KNOWS OUR DESIRES OUR WISH TO KNOW MUST BE A TORMENT TO HER WHO CAN TELL THAT SHOULD WE LEARN THE SECRET OF HER MYSTERY
2050-164335-0022 IT WOULD NOT PRECIPITATE A TRAGEDY MORE TERRIBLE THAN THAT WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN ENACTED HERE WHO CAN TELL IF IT MIGHT NOT MEAN HER DEATH YET IT HAD BROUGHT HER CLOSE TO DEATH AND WE STILL KNEW NOTHING OR RATHER
2050-164335-0023 THERE ARE SOME OF US WHO KNOW NOTHING BUT I IF I KNEW WHO I SHOULD KNOW ALL WHO WHO NOT KNOWING WHO I MUST REMAIN SILENT OUT OF PITY FOR HER
2050-164335-0024 AND YET SHE KEEPS THE SECRET WHEN I KNOW WHO I WILL SPEAK TO HIM TO HIM SHE LOOKED AT US NOW WITH A FAR AWAY LOOK IN HER EYES AS IF WE WERE NOT IN THE CHAMBER MONSIEUR STANGERSON BROKE THE SILENCE
2050-164335-0025 HE DECLARED THAT HENCEFORTH HE WOULD NO MORE ABSENT HIMSELF FROM HIS DAUGHTER'S APARTMENTS SHE TRIED TO OPPOSE HIM IN VAIN HE ADHERED FIRMLY TO HIS PURPOSE HE WOULD INSTALL HIMSELF THERE THIS VERY NIGHT HE SAID
2050-164335-0026 THEN HE SUDDENLY BEGAN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE WERE A LITTLE CHILD HE SMILED AT HER AND SEEMED NOT TO KNOW EITHER WHAT HE SAID OR WHAT HE DID THE ILLUSTRIOUS PROFESSOR HAD LOST HIS HEAD
2050-164335-0027 AND FREDERIC LARSAN HIMSELF IS OBLIGED TO TURN AWAY TO HIDE HIS EMOTION FOR MYSELF I AM ABLE NEITHER TO THINK OR FEEL I FELT AN INFINITE CONTEMPT FOR MYSELF
2050-164335-0028 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT FREDERIC LARSAN LIKE MYSELF
2050-164335-0029 LIKE ME HE HAD INSISTED ON BEING ALLOWED TO QUESTION THE UNHAPPY LADY
2050-164335-0030 TO HIM AS TO ME THE SAME ANSWER HAD ALWAYS BEEN GIVEN MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON WAS TOO WEAK TO RECEIVE US THE QUESTIONINGS OF THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE HAD OVER FATIGUED HER
2050-164335-0031 IT WAS EVIDENTLY INTENDED NOT TO GIVE US ANY ASSISTANCE IN OUR RESEARCHES I WAS NOT SURPRISED BUT FREDERIC LARSAN HAD ALWAYS RESENTED THIS CONDUCT IT IS TRUE THAT HE AND I HAD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THEORY OF THE CRIME
2050-164335-0032 I STILL CATCH MYSELF REPEATING FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART SAVE HER SAVE HER WITHOUT HIS SPEAKING
2050-164335-0033 TAKE HIM AND SHUT HIS MOUTH BUT MONSIEUR DARZAC MADE IT CLEAR THAT IN ORDER TO SHUT HIS MOUTH HE MUST BE KILLED HAVE I THE RIGHT TO KILL MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S MURDERER NO I HAD NOT
2050-164335-0034 BUT LET HIM ONLY GIVE ME THE CHANCE LET ME FIND OUT WHETHER HE IS REALLY A CREATURE OF FLESH AND BLOOD LET ME SEE HIS DEAD BODY SINCE IT CANNOT BE TAKEN ALIVE
2050-164335-0035 IF I COULD BUT MAKE THIS WOMAN WHO DOES NOT EVEN LOOK AT US UNDERSTAND SHE IS ABSORBED BY HER FEARS AND BY HER FATHER'S DISTRESS OF MIND AND I CAN DO NOTHING TO SAVE HER YES
2050-164335-0036 I WILL GO TO WORK ONCE MORE AND ACCOMPLISH WONDERS I MOVE TOWARDS HER
2050-164335-0037 I WOULD ENTREAT HER TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN ME I WOULD IN A WORD MAKE HER UNDERSTAND SHE ALONE THAT I KNOW HOW THE MURDERER ESCAPED FROM THE YELLOW ROOM THAT I HAVE GUESSED THE MOTIVES FOR HER SECRECY AND THAT I PITY HER WITH ALL MY HEART
2050-164335-0038 BUT BY HER GESTURES SHE BEGGED US TO LEAVE HER ALONE EXPRESSING WEARINESS AND THE NEED FOR IMMEDIATE REST MONSIEUR STANGERSON ASKED US TO GO BACK TO OUR ROOMS AND THANKED US FREDERIC LARSAN AND I BOWED TO HIM AND FOLLOWED BY DADDY JACQUES WE REGAINED THE GALLERY
2050-164335-0039 I HEARD LARSAN MURMUR STRANGE STRANGE HE MADE A SIGN TO ME TO GO WITH HIM INTO HIS ROOM ON THE THRESHOLD HE TURNED TOWARDS DADDY JACQUES DID YOU SEE HIM DISTINCTLY HE ASKED WHO THE MAN
2050-164335-0040 I SAID AND TO ME SAID LARSAN THE GREAT FRED AND I WERE ALONE IN HIS CHAMBER NOW TO TALK OVER THIS THING WE TALKED FOR AN HOUR TURNING THE MATTER OVER AND VIEWING IT FROM EVERY SIDE
2050-164335-0041 FROM THE QUESTIONS PUT BY HIM FROM THE EXPLANATION WHICH HE GIVES ME IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT IN SPITE OF ALL OUR SENSES
2050-164335-0042 KNOWN TO HIM ALONE HE KNOWS THE CHATEAU HE SAID TO ME HE KNOWS IT WELL
2050-164335-0043 I SUGGESTED HE IS AS TALL AS HE WANTS TO BE MURMURED FRED I UNDERSTAND I SAID BUT HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR HIS RED HAIR AND BEARD TOO MUCH BEARD TOO MUCH HAIR FALSE SAYS FRED
2050-164335-0044 SO MUCH THE BETTER I HOPE SO BUT EVERYTHING CONDEMNS HIM DID YOU NOTICE THE MARKS ON THE CARPET COME AND LOOK AT THEM I HAVE SEEN THEM THEY ARE THE MARKS OF THE NEAT BOOTS THE SAME AS THOSE WE SAW ON THE BORDER OF THE LAKE
2050-164335-0045 CAN YOU DENY THAT THEY BELONG TO ROBERT DARZAC OF COURSE ONE MAY BE MISTAKEN HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT THOSE FOOTPRINTS ONLY GO IN ONE DIRECTION THAT THERE ARE NO RETURN MARKS WHEN THE MAN CAME FROM THE CHAMBER PURSUED BY ALL OF US
2050-164335-0046 HIS FOOTSTEPS LEFT NO TRACES BEHIND THEM HE HAD PERHAPS BEEN IN THE CHAMBER FOR HOURS
2050-164335-0047 I SUDDENLY PUT AN END TO THIS IDLE CHATTER VOID OF ANY LOGIC AND MADE A SIGN TO LARSAN TO LISTEN THERE BELOW SOME ONE IS SHUTTING A DOOR I RISE LARSAN FOLLOWS ME WE DESCEND TO THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE CHATEAU
2050-164335-0048 I LEAD HIM TO THE LITTLE SEMI CIRCULAR ROOM UNDER THE TERRACE BENEATH THE WINDOW OF THE OFF TURNING GALLERY I POINT TO THE DOOR NOW CLOSED OPEN A SHORT TIME BEFORE UNDER WHICH A SHAFT OF LIGHT IS VISIBLE THE FOREST KEEPER SAYS FRED
2050-164335-0049 I GO TO THE DOOR AND RAP SMARTLY ON IT
2050-164335-0050 WE COULD ONLY HAVE ANSWERED THAT THE ASSASSIN HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE GALLERY IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE THOUGHT HE WAS NO LONGER ANYWHERE HE HAD ELUDED US WHEN WE ALL HAD OUR HANDS STRETCHED OUT READY TO SEIZE HIM WHEN WE WERE ALMOST TOUCHING HIM
2050-164335-0051 WE HAD NO LONGER ANY GROUND FOR HOPING THAT WE COULD CLEAR UP THE MYSTERY OF THAT NIGHT AS SOON AS I RAPPED AT THE DOOR IT WAS OPENED AND THE KEEPER ASKED US QUIETLY WHAT WE WANTED HE WAS UNDRESSED AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
2050-164335-0052 WE ENTERED AND I AFFECTED SURPRISE NOT GONE TO BED YET NO HE REPLIED ROUGHLY I HAVE BEEN MAKING A ROUND OF THE PARK AND IN THE WOODS I AM ONLY JUST BACK AND SLEEPY GOOD NIGHT LISTEN I SAID
2050-164335-0053 AN HOUR OR SO AGO THERE WAS A LADDER CLOSE BY YOUR WINDOW WHAT LADDER I DID NOT SEE ANY LADDER GOOD NIGHT
2050-164335-0054 WHEN WE WERE OUTSIDE I LOOKED AT LARSAN HIS FACE WAS IMPENETRABLE WELL I SAID WELL HE REPEATED
2050-164335-0055 THERE WAS NO MISTAKING LARSAN'S BAD TEMPER ON RE ENTERING THE CHATEAU I HEARD HIM MUTTER IT WOULD BE STRANGE
