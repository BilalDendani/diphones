2943-171000-0000 THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY ARTHUR
2943-171000-0001 WHEN ELSIE SEEING A GOLD CHAIN DEPENDING FROM THE POCKET OF ARTHUR'S JACKET EXCLAIMED
2943-171000-0002 DO PUT IT AWAY FOR YOU WILL BE ALMOST SURE TO INJURE IT HOLD YOUR TONGUE ELSIE I'LL DO AS I PLEASE WAS THE POLITE REJOINDER BUT ARTHUR YOU KNOW THAT GRANDPA WOULD NEVER LET YOU TAKE IT
2943-171000-0003 I HAVE OFTEN HEARD HIM SAY THAT IT WAS VERY VALUABLE
2943-171000-0004 AND YOU KNOW I CANNOT TELL A LIE AND IF HE ASKS ME IF IT WAS YOU I CANNOT SAY NO YES I'LL TRUST YOU FOR TELLING TALES REPLIED ARTHUR SNEERINGLY
2943-171000-0005 HE RAN DOWN THE AVENUE AS HE SPOKE WALTER AND ENNA FOLLOWING AND ELSIE SLOWLY BRINGING UP THE REAR LOOKING THE PICTURE OF DISTRESS FOR SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO SEEING THAT ARTHUR WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HER REMONSTRANCES AND AS OFTEN HAPPENED
2943-171000-0006 ALL THE OLDER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WERE OUT
2943-171000-0007 ONCE SHE THOUGHT OF TURNING BACK
2943-171000-0008 BUT REMEMBERING THAT HER FATHER TOLD HER SHE MUST WALK WITH THE OTHERS THAT AFTERNOON
2943-171000-0009 HER TESTIMONY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO CONVICT HIM EVEN IF SHE SAW NO MORE SHE GAVE UP THE IDEA AND HURRIED ON WITH THE FAINT HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO INDUCE ARTHUR TO REFRAIN FROM INDULGING IN SUCH SPORTS AS WOULD BE LIKELY TO ENDANGER THE WATCH OR ELSE TO GIVE IT INTO HER CHARGE
2943-171000-0010 BUT NOW SHE FELT SO SURE IT WOULD BE SAFER WITH HER THAN WITH HIM
2943-171000-0011 THE WALK WAS FAR FROM BEING A PLEASURE THAT AFTERNOON
2943-171000-0012 STRIKING WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE ELSIE UTTERED A SCREAM AND ARTHUR NOW THOROUGHLY FRIGHTENED HIMSELF
2943-171000-0013 THE CRYSTAL WAS BROKEN THE BACK DENTED AND HOW MUCH THE WORKS WERE INJURED THEY COULD NOT TELL BUT IT HAD CEASED TO RUN
2943-171000-0014 WHILE ELSIE STOOD PALE AND TREMBLING NOT SPEAKING A WORD YOU HUSH EXCLAIMED ARTHUR FIERCELY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
2943-171000-0015 I DON'T CARE WHO GETS PUNISHED SO THAT PAPA DOES NOT FIND OUT THAT I DID IT SAID HE FURIOUSLY
2943-171000-0016 I'LL PAY YOU FOR IT I SHALL SAY NOTHING UNLESS IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO SAVE THE INNOCENT OR I AM FORCED TO SPEAK BUT IN THAT CASE I SHALL TELL THE TRUTH REPLIED ELSIE FIRMLY ARTHUR DOUBLED UP HIS FIST AND MADE A PLUNGE AT HER AS IF HE MEANT TO KNOCK HER DOWN
2943-171000-0017 BUT ELSIE SPRANG BEHIND THE TREE AND THEN RAN SO FLEETLY TOWARD THE HOUSE THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO OVERTAKE HER UNTIL HIS PASSION HAD HAD TIME TO COOL WHEN THEY REACHED THE HOUSE ARTHUR REPLACED THE WATCH ON HIS FATHER'S TABLE WHENCE HE HAD TAKEN IT
2943-171000-0018 HE LOOKED AT HER AGAIN A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY BUT SAID NO MORE AND AS SOON AS THE MEAL WAS CONCLUDED ELSIE HASTENED AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM AGAIN IT WAS STILL EARLY IN THE EVENING
2943-171000-0019 FOR ONCE BRINGING NO COMPANY WITH THEM AND HE HAD NOT BEEN MANY MINUTES IN THE HOUSE ERE HE TOOK UP HIS WATCH AND OF COURSE INSTANTLY DISCOVERED THE INJURY IT HAD SUSTAINED HIS SUSPICIONS AT ONCE FELL UPON ARTHUR WHOSE CHARACTER FOR MISCHIEF WAS WELL ESTABLISHED AND BURNING WITH RAGE
2943-171000-0020 WATCH IN HAND HE REPAIRED TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHICH HE ENTERED ASKING IN TONES TREMULOUS WITH PASSION
2943-171000-0021 HE ADDED HOLDING UP THE INJURED ARTICLE MY DEAR HOW CAN YOU SAY SO HAVE YOU ANY PROOF ASKED HIS WIFE DEPRECATINGLY

2943-171000-0024 EXCLAIMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PACING ANGRILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM ARTHUR

2943-171000-0029 ELSIE WAS SITTING IN HER OWN ROOM TRYING TO LEARN A LESSON FOR THE NEXT DAY BUT FINDING GREAT DIFFICULTY IN FIXING HER THOUGHTS UPON IT WHEN SHE WAS STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN ENTRANCE OF AUNT CHLOE WHO WITH HER APRON TO HER EYES WAS SOBBING VIOLENTLY
2943-171000-0030 STARTING TO HER FEET AND DROPPING HER BOOK IN HER HASTE AND FRIGHT WHY SOBBED CHLOE

2943-171000-0032 BUT JIM HAS DONE VERY WRONG AND DESERVES HIS PUNISHMENT AND I CANNOT INTERFERE
2943-171000-0033 IS IT POSSIBLE SAID HE IN A TONE OF SURPRISE
2943-171000-0034 AND HE LOOKED SEARCHINGLY INTO HER FACE

2943-171000-0040 AND HE WOULD MAKE IT UP TO JIM SOMEHOW EVEN IF IT TOOK ALL HIS POCKET MONEY FOR A MONTH NONE OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY HAD LEFT THE ROOM AND ALL WORE AN ANXIOUS EXPECTANT LOOK AS MISTER DINSMORE ENTERED LEADING ELSIE BY THE HAND
2943-171000-0041 I HAVE BROUGHT YOU ANOTHER WITNESS SIR HE SAID FOR IT SEEMS ELSIE WAS PRESENT WHEN THE MISCHIEF WAS DONE AH EXCLAIMED THE OLD GENTLEMEN THEN I MAY HOPE TO GET AT THE TRUTH ELSIE WHO BROKE MY WATCH IT WAS NOT JIM GRANDPA INDEED INDEED IT WAS NOT BUT

2943-171000-0044 NO ONE SHALL HURT YOU FOR TELLING THE TRUTH EXCLAIMED HER GRANDFATHER IMPATIENTLY
2943-171000-0045 I KNEW IT FROM THE FIRST CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN STRIDING ACROSS THE ROOM SEIZING THE BOY BY THE SHOULDER AND SHAKING HIM ROUGHLY BUT GO ON ELSIE LET US HAVE THE WHOLE STORY HE ADDED TURNING TO HER AGAIN BUT STILL KEEPING HIS HOLD UPON ARTHUR
2943-171000-0046 YOU YOUNG DOG HE ADDED WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED YES I'LL FORGIVE YOU
2943-171000-0047 WILL YOU ARTHUR LET ME PAY FOR THE WATCH GRANDPA AND DON'T PUNISH HIM I WOULD SO LIKE TO DO IT IT ISN'T THE MONEYED VALUE OF THE WATCH I CARE FOR CHILD REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN CONTEMPTUOUSLY
2943-171000-0048 SAID THE ELDER GENTLEMAN WITH ALMOST FIERCE DETERMINATION AS HE TIGHTENED HIS GRASP UPON THE BOY'S ARM AND DRAGGED HIM FROM THE ROOM ARTHUR CAST A LOOK OF HATRED AND DEFIANCE AT ELSIE AS HE WENT OUT THAT MADE HER GROW PALE WITH FEAR AND TREMBLE SO THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY STAND
2943-171000-0049 HER FATHER SAW BOTH THE LOOK AND ITS EFFECT AND DRAWING THE LITTLE TREMBLER CLOSER TO HIM HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER AND STROKING HER HAIR SAID IN A LOW SOOTHING TONE
2943-171000-0050 AND HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO TAKE HER ON HIS KNEE WHEN VISITORS WERE ANNOUNCED AND CHANGING HIS MIND HE DISMISSED HER TO HER ROOM AND SHE SAW NO MORE OF HIM THAT EVENING OH IF THEY ONLY HADN'T COME JUST NOW THOUGHT THE SORELY DISAPPOINTED CHILD
2943-171000-0051 DEAR DEAR PAPA IF YOU COULD ONLY KNOW HOW I LONG TO SIT THERE BUT MISSUS DINSMORE WHO HAD HASTILY RETIRED ON THE EXIT OF ARTHUR AND HIS FATHER FROM THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOW SAILING MAJESTICALLY DOWN THE HALL ON HER RETURN THITHER
2943-171000-0052 THE POOR OLD CREATURE WAS OVERFLOWING WITH GRATITUDE AND HER FERVENT OUTPOURING OF THANKS AND BLESSINGS ALMOST MADE ELSIE FORGET HER DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE TIME THEN JIM CAME TO THE DOOR ASKING TO SEE MISS ELSIE AND POURED OUT HIS THANKS AMID MANY SOBS AND TEARS
2943-171000-0053 BUT AT LENGTH PHOEBE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD SOME BAKING TO DO AND CALLING ON JIM TO COME RIGHT ALONG AND SPLIT UP SOME DRY WOOD TO HEAT HER OVEN SHE WENT DOWN TO THE KITCHEN FOLLOWED BY HER SON AND ELSIE WAS LEFT ALONE WITH HER NURSE
2943-171000-0054 CHLOE SAT SILENTLY KNITTING AND THE LITTLE GIRL WITH HER HEAD LEANING UPON HER HAND AND HER EYES FIXED THOUGHTFULLY UPON THE FLOOR WAS REHEARSING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN HER OWN MIND ALL THAT HAD JUST PASSED BETWEEN HER PAPA AND HERSELF
2943-171000-0055 DWELLING WITH LINGERING DELIGHT UPON EVERYTHING APPROACHING TO A CARESS EVERY KIND WORD EVERY SOOTHING TONE OF HIS VOICE AND THEN PICTURING TO HERSELF ALL THAT HE MIGHT HAVE DONE AND SAID IF THOSE UNWELCOME VISITORS HAD NOT COME IN AND PUT AN END TO THE INTERVIEW
2943-171000-0056 AND HALF HOPING THAT HE WOULD SEND FOR HER WHEN THEY HAD GONE SHE WATCHED THE CLOCK AND LISTENED INTENTLY FOR EVERY SOUND BUT HER BEDTIME CAME AND SHE DARED NOT STAY UP ANY LONGER FOR HIS ORDERS HAD BEEN PEREMPTORY THAT SHE SHOULD ALWAYS RETIRE PRECISELY AT THAT HOUR
2943-171000-0057 UNLESS SHE HAD HIS EXPRESS PERMISSION TO REMAIN UP LONGER SHE LAY AWAKE FOR SOME TIME THINKING OF HIS UNWONTED KINDNESS AND INDULGING FOND HOPES FOR THE FUTURE THEN FELL ASLEEP TO DREAM
2943-171000-0058 THAT SHE WAS ON HER FATHER'S KNEE AND FELT HIS ARMS FOLDED LOVINGLY ABOUT HER AND HIS KISSES WARM UPON HER CHEEK HER HEART BEAT QUICKLY AS SHE ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING THE FAMILY WERE JUST TAKING THEIR PLACES AT THE TABLE
2943-171000-0059 EXCEPTING TO SEE THAT HER PLATE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH SUCH ARTICLES OF FOOD AS HE ALLOWED HER TO EAT ELSIE WAS SADLY DISAPPOINTED AND LINGERED ABOUT THE ROOM IN THE VAIN HOPE OF OBTAINING A SMILE OR CARESS BUT PRESENTLY HER FATHER WENT OUT
2943-171000-0060 SAYING TO THE ELDER MISTER DINSMORE THAT HE WAS GOING TO RIDE OVER TO ION AND WOULD PROBABLY NOT RETURN BEFORE NIGHT THEN WITH A SIGH THE LITTLE GIRL WENT BACK TO HER OWN ROOM TO PREPARE HER MORNING LESSONS
2943-171000-0061 ELSIE WAS NOW HAPPILY FREE FROM ARTHUR'S PERSECUTIONS FOR A TIME FOR EVEN AFTER HIS RELEASE HE WAS TOO MUCH AFRAID OF HIS BROTHER OPENLY TO OFFER HER ANY VERY SERIOUS ANNOYANCE THOUGH HE PLOTTED REVENGE IN SECRET
2943-171000-0062 YET THE LITTLE GIRL'S SITUATION WAS FAR FROM COMFORTABLE AND HER PATIENCE OFTEN SEVERELY TRIED FOR MISSUS DINSMORE WAS EXCESSIVELY ANGRY WITH HER ON ARTHUR'S ACCOUNT AND WHENEVER HER FATHER WAS NOT PRESENT TREATED HER IN THE MOST UNKIND MANNER AND FROM THE SAME CAUSE THE REST OF THE FAMILY
2943-171000-0063 WERE UNUSUALLY COLD AND DISTANT WHILE HER FATHER ALTHOUGH CAREFUL TO SEE THAT ALL HER WANTS WERE ATTENDED TO SELDOM TOOK ANY FURTHER NOTICE OF HER UNLESS TO REPROVE HER FOR SOME CHILDISH FAULT WHICH HOWEVER TRIFLING NEVER ESCAPED HIS EYE
2943-171000-0064 YOU SEEM SAID ADELAIDE TO HIM ONE DAY AS HE SENT ELSIE FROM THE ROOM FOR SOME VERY SLIGHT FAULT TO EXPECT THAT CHILD TO BE A GREAT DEAL MORE PERFECT THAN ANY GROWN PERSON I EVER SAW AND TO UNDERSTAND ALL ABOUT THE RULES OF ETIQUETTE
2943-171000-0065 IF YOU PLEASE ADELAIDE SAID HE HAUGHTILY I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ALLOWED TO MANAGE MY OWN CHILD AS I SEE PROPER WITHOUT ANY INTERFERENCE FROM OTHERS
