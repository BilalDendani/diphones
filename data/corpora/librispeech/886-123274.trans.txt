886-123274-0000 WE HAD TO HASTEN FORWARD IT WAS A THREE DAYS MARCH TO THE CROSS ROADS I WILL NOT SPEAK OF THE SUFFERINGS WE ENDURED IN OUR RETURN MY UNCLE BORE THEM WITH THE ANGRY IMPATIENCE OF A MAN OBLIGED TO OWN HIS WEAKNESS
886-123274-0001 HANS WITH THE RESIGNATION OF HIS PASSIVE NATURE I I CONFESS WITH COMPLAINTS AND EXPRESSIONS OF DESPAIR I HAD NO SPIRIT TO OPPOSE THIS ILL FORTUNE AS I HAD FORETOLD
886-123274-0002 THE WATER FAILED ENTIRELY BY THE END OF THE FIRST DAY'S RETROGRADE MARCH OUR FLUID ALIMENT WAS NOW NOTHING BUT GIN BUT THIS INFERNAL FLUID BURNED MY THROAT AND I COULD NOT EVEN ENDURE THE SIGHT OF IT I FOUND THE TEMPERATURE AND THE AIR STIFLING
886-123274-0003 MORE THAN ONCE I DROPPED DOWN MOTIONLESS THEN THERE WAS A HALT AND MY UNCLE AND THE ICELANDER DID THEIR BEST TO RESTORE ME BUT I SAW THAT THE FORMER WAS STRUGGLING PAINFULLY AGAINST EXCESSIVE FATIGUE AND THE TORTURES OF THIRST
886-123274-0004 AT LAST ON TUESDAY JULY EIGHTH WE ARRIVED ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES AND HALF DEAD AT THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO ROADS THERE I DROPPED LIKE A LIFELESS LUMP EXTENDED ON THE LAVA SOIL IT WAS TEN IN THE MORNING
886-123274-0005 HANS AND MY UNCLE CLINGING TO THE WALL TRIED TO NIBBLE A FEW BITS OF BISCUIT LONG MOANS ESCAPED FROM MY SWOLLEN LIPS AFTER SOME TIME MY UNCLE APPROACHED ME AND RAISED ME IN HIS ARMS
886-123274-0006 SAID HE IN GENUINE TONES OF COMPASSION I WAS TOUCHED WITH THESE WORDS NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO SEE THE EXCITABLE PROFESSOR IN A SOFTENED MOOD I GRASPED HIS TREMBLING HANDS IN MINE HE LET ME HOLD THEM AND LOOKED AT ME
886-123274-0007 HIS EYES WERE MOISTENED THEN I SAW HIM TAKE THE FLASK THAT WAS HANGING AT HIS SIDE TO MY AMAZEMENT HE PLACED IT ON MY LIPS DRINK SAID HE HAD I HEARD HIM WAS MY UNCLE BESIDE HIMSELF
886-123274-0008 I STARED AT HIM STUPIDLY AND FELT AS IF I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM DRINK HE SAID AGAIN AND RAISING HIS FLASK HE EMPTIED IT EVERY DROP BETWEEN MY LIPS OH INFINITE PLEASURE
886-123274-0009 A SLENDER SIP OF WATER CAME TO MOISTEN MY BURNING MOUTH IT WAS BUT ONE SIP BUT IT WAS ENOUGH TO RECALL MY EBBING LIFE I THANKED MY UNCLE WITH CLASPED HANDS YES HE SAID A DRAUGHT OF WATER
886-123274-0010 BUT IT IS THE VERY LAST YOU HEAR THE LAST I HAD KEPT IT AS A PRECIOUS TREASURE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY FLASK TWENTY TIMES NAY A HUNDRED TIMES HAVE I FOUGHT AGAINST A FRIGHTFUL IMPULSE TO DRINK IT OFF BUT NO AXEL I KEPT IT FOR YOU
886-123274-0011 MY DEAR UNCLE I SAID WHILST HOT TEARS TRICKLED DOWN MY FACE YES MY POOR BOY I KNEW THAT AS SOON AS YOU ARRIVED AT THESE CROSS ROADS YOU WOULD DROP HALF DEAD AND I KEPT MY LAST DROP OF WATER TO REANIMATE YOU
886-123274-0012 THANK YOU THANK YOU I SAID ALTHOUGH MY THIRST WAS ONLY PARTIALLY QUENCHED YET SOME STRENGTH HAD RETURNED THE MUSCLES OF MY THROAT UNTIL THEN CONTRACTED NOW RELAXED AGAIN AND THE INFLAMMATION OF MY LIPS ABATED SOMEWHAT
886-123274-0013 AND I WAS NOW ABLE TO SPEAK LET US SEE I SAID WE HAVE NOW BUT ONE THING TO DO WE HAVE NO WATER WE MUST GO BACK WHILE I SPOKE MY UNCLE AVOIDED LOOKING AT ME HE HUNG HIS HEAD DOWN
886-123274-0014 HIS EYES AVOIDED MINE WE MUST RETURN I EXCLAIMED VEHEMENTLY WE MUST GO BACK ON OUR WAY TO SNAEFELL MAY GOD GIVE US STRENGTH TO CLIMB UP THE CRATER AGAIN RETURN SAID MY UNCLE
886-123274-0015 AS IF HE WAS RATHER ANSWERING HIMSELF THAN ME YES RETURN WITHOUT THE LOSS OF A MINUTE A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED SO THEN AXEL REPLIED THE PROFESSOR IRONICALLY
886-123274-0016 YOU HAVE FOUND NO COURAGE OR ENERGY IN THESE FEW DROPS OF WATER COURAGE I SEE YOU JUST AS FEEBLE MINDED AS YOU WERE BEFORE AND STILL EXPRESSING ONLY DESPAIR
886-123274-0017 WHAT SORT OF A MAN WAS THIS I HAD TO DO WITH AND WHAT SCHEMES WAS HE NOW REVOLVING IN HIS FEARLESS MIND WHAT YOU WON'T GO BACK SHOULD I RENOUNCE THIS EXPEDITION JUST WHEN WE HAVE THE FAIREST CHANCE OF SUCCESS NEVER
886-123274-0018 THEN MUST WE RESIGN OURSELVES TO DESTRUCTION NO AXEL NO GO BACK HANS WILL GO WITH YOU LEAVE ME TO MYSELF LEAVE YOU HERE LEAVE ME I TELL YOU I HAVE UNDERTAKEN THIS EXPEDITION
886-123274-0019 I WILL CARRY IT OUT TO THE END AND I WILL NOT RETURN GO AXEL GO MY UNCLE WAS IN HIGH STATE OF EXCITEMENT HIS VOICE WHICH HAD FOR A MOMENT BEEN TENDER AND GENTLE HAD NOW BECOME HARD AND THREATENING
886-123274-0020 HE WAS STRUGGLING WITH GLOOMY RESOLUTIONS AGAINST IMPOSSIBILITIES I WOULD NOT LEAVE HIM IN THIS BOTTOMLESS ABYSS AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE INSTINCT OF SELF PRESERVATION PROMPTED ME TO FLY
886-123274-0021 THE GUIDE WATCHED THIS SCENE WITH HIS USUAL PHLEGMATIC UNCONCERN YET HE UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY WELL WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN HIS TWO COMPANIONS THE GESTURES THEMSELVES WERE SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT WE WERE EACH BENT ON TAKING A DIFFERENT ROAD
886-123274-0022 BUT HANS SEEMED TO TAKE NO PART IN A QUESTION UPON WHICH DEPENDED HIS LIFE HE WAS READY TO START AT A GIVEN SIGNAL OR TO STAY IF HIS MASTER SO WILLED IT HOW I WISHED AT THIS MOMENT I COULD HAVE MADE HIM UNDERSTAND ME
886-123274-0023 MY WORDS MY COMPLAINTS MY SORROW WOULD HAVE HAD SOME INFLUENCE OVER THAT FRIGID NATURE THOSE DANGERS WHICH OUR GUIDE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND I COULD HAVE DEMONSTRATED AND PROVED TO HIM TOGETHER WE MIGHT HAVE OVER RULED THE OBSTINATE PROFESSOR
886-123274-0024 IF IT WERE NEEDED WE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE COMPELLED HIM TO REGAIN THE HEIGHTS OF SNAEFELL I DREW NEAR TO HANS I PLACED MY HAND UPON HIS HE MADE NO MOVEMENT MY PARTED LIPS SUFFICIENTLY REVEALED MY SUFFERINGS
886-123274-0025 THE ICELANDER SLOWLY MOVED HIS HEAD AND CALMLY POINTING TO MY UNCLE SAID MASTER MASTER I SHOUTED YOU MADMAN NO HE IS NOT THE MASTER OF OUR LIFE WE MUST FLY WE MUST DRAG HIM DO YOU HEAR ME
886-123274-0026 I HAD SEIZED HANS BY THE ARM I WISHED TO OBLIGE HIM TO RISE I STROVE WITH HIM MY UNCLE INTERPOSED BE CALM AXEL YOU WILL GET NOTHING FROM THAT IMMOVABLE SERVANT THEREFORE LISTEN TO MY PROPOSAL
886-123274-0027 I CROSSED MY ARMS AND CONFRONTED MY UNCLE BOLDLY THE WANT OF WATER HE SAID IS THE ONLY OBSTACLE IN OUR WAY IN THIS EASTERN GALLERY MADE UP OF LAVAS SCHISTS AND COAL WE HAVE NOT MET WITH A SINGLE PARTICLE OF MOISTURE
886-123274-0028 PERHAPS WE SHALL BE MORE FORTUNATE IF WE FOLLOW THE WESTERN TUNNEL I SHOOK MY HEAD INCREDULOUSLY HEAR ME TO THE END THE PROFESSOR WENT ON WITH A FIRM VOICE
886-123274-0029 WHILST YOU WERE LYING THERE MOTIONLESS I WENT TO EXAMINE THE CONFORMATION OF THAT GALLERY IT PENETRATES DIRECTLY DOWNWARD AND IN A FEW HOURS IT WILL BRING US TO THE GRANITE ROCKS THERE WE MUST MEET WITH ABUNDANT SPRINGS
886-123274-0030 THE NATURE OF THE ROCK ASSURES ME OF THIS AND INSTINCT AGREES WITH LOGIC TO SUPPORT MY CONVICTION NOW THIS IS MY PROPOSAL WHEN COLUMBUS ASKED OF HIS SHIPS CREWS FOR THREE DAYS MORE TO DISCOVER A NEW WORLD THOSE CREWS
886-123274-0031 DISHEARTENED AND SICK AS THEY WERE RECOGNISED THE JUSTICE OF THE CLAIM AND HE DISCOVERED AMERICA I AM THE COLUMBUS OF THIS NETHER WORLD AND I ONLY ASK FOR ONE MORE DAY
886-123274-0032 IF IN A SINGLE DAY I HAVE NOT MET WITH THE WATER THAT WE WANT I SWEAR TO YOU WE WILL RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IN SPITE OF MY IRRITATION I WAS MOVED WITH THESE WORDS
886-123274-0033 AS WELL AS WITH THE VIOLENCE MY UNCLE WAS DOING TO HIS OWN WISHES IN MAKING SO HAZARDOUS A PROPOSAL WELL I SAID DO AS YOU WILL AND GOD REWARD YOUR SUPERHUMAN ENERGY YOU HAVE NOW BUT A FEW HOURS TO TEMPT FORTUNE
