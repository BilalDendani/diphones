1392-135659-0000 WHICH LEADS US TO EXPECT FROM ANY CAUSE THE SAME EVENTS WHICH WE HAVE OBSERVED TO RESULT FROM SIMILAR CAUSES WHERE THE CAUSES ARE ENTIRELY SIMILAR THE ANALOGY IS PERFECT AND THE INFERENCE DRAWN FROM IT
1392-135659-0001 IS REGARDED AS CERTAIN AND CONCLUSIVE NOR DOES ANY MAN EVER ENTERTAIN A DOUBT WHERE HE SEES A PIECE OF IRON THAT IT WILL HAVE WEIGHT AND COHESION OF PARTS AS IN ALL OTHER INSTANCES WHICH HAVE EVER FALLEN UNDER HIS OBSERVATION
1392-135659-0002 BUT WHERE THE OBJECTS HAVE NOT SO EXACT A SIMILARITY THE ANALOGY IS LESS PERFECT AND THE INFERENCE IS LESS CONCLUSIVE THOUGH STILL IT HAS SOME FORCE IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF SIMILARITY AND RESEMBLANCE
1392-135659-0003 THE ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS FORMED UPON ONE ANIMAL ARE BY THIS SPECIES OF REASONING EXTENDED TO ALL ANIMALS AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT WHEN THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD FOR INSTANCE
1392-135659-0004 OF WHICH WE ARE NOW TREATING AND ANY THEORY BY WHICH WE EXPLAIN THE OPERATIONS OF THE UNDERSTANDING OR THE ORIGIN AND CONNEXION OF THE PASSIONS IN MAN WILL ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY IF WE FIND
1392-135659-0005 ENDEAVOURED TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL EXPERIMENTAL REASONINGS AND IT IS HOPED THAT THIS NEW POINT OF VIEW
1392-135659-0006 WITH THE MORE OBVIOUS PROPERTIES OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS AND GRADUALLY FROM THEIR BIRTH TREASURE UP A KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF FIRE WATER EARTH STONES HEIGHTS DEPTHS
1392-135659-0007 THE IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE OF THE YOUNG ARE HERE PLAINLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE CUNNING AND SAGACITY OF THE OLD WHO HAVE LEARNED BY LONG OBSERVATION TO AVOID WHAT HURT THEM AND TO PURSUE WHAT GAVE EASE OR PLEASURE
1392-135659-0008 A HORSE THAT HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THE FIELD BECOMES ACQUAINTED WITH THE PROPER HEIGHT WHICH HE CAN LEAP AND WILL NEVER ATTEMPT WHAT EXCEEDS HIS FORCE AND ABILITY AN OLD GREYHOUND
1392-135659-0009 WILL TRUST THE MORE FATIGUING PART OF THE CHACE TO THE YOUNGER AND WILL PLACE HIMSELF SO AS TO MEET THE HARE IN HER DOUBLES NOR ARE THE CONJECTURES WHICH HE FORMS ON THIS OCCASION FOUNDED IN ANY THING
1392-135659-0010 MAY BE TAUGHT ANY COURSE OF ACTION AND MOST CONTRARY TO THEIR NATURAL INSTINCTS AND PROPENSITIES IS IT NOT EXPERIENCE WHICH RENDERS A DOG APPREHENSIVE OF PAIN WHEN YOU MENACE HIM OR LIFT UP THE WHIP TO BEAT HIM
1392-135659-0011 IS IT NOT EVEN EXPERIENCE WHICH MAKES HIM ANSWER TO HIS NAME AND INFER FROM SUCH AN ARBITRARY SOUND THAT YOU MEAN HIM RATHER THAN ANY OF HIS FELLOWS AND INTEND TO CALL HIM WHEN YOU PRONOUNCE IT IN A CERTAIN MANNER
1392-135659-0012 AND WITH A CERTAIN TONE AND ACCENT IN ALL THESE CASES WE MAY OBSERVE THAT THE ANIMAL INFERS SOME FACT BEYOND WHAT IMMEDIATELY STRIKES HIS SENSES AND THAT THIS INFERENCE IS ALTOGETHER FOUNDED ON PAST EXPERIENCE
1392-135659-0013 WHILE THE CREATURE EXPECTS FROM THE PRESENT OBJECT THE SAME CONSEQUENCES WHICH IT HAS ALWAYS FOUND
1392-135659-0014 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THIS INFERENCE OF THE ANIMAL CAN BE FOUNDED ON ANY PROCESS OF ARGUMENT OR REASONING BY WHICH HE CONCLUDES THAT LIKE EVENTS MUST FOLLOW LIKE OBJECTS
1392-135659-0015 AND THAT THE COURSE OF NATURE WILL ALWAYS BE REGULAR IN ITS OPERATIONS FOR IF THERE BE IN REALITY ANY ARGUMENTS OF THIS NATURE THEY SURELY LIE TOO ABSTRUSE FOR THE OBSERVATION OF SUCH IMPERFECT UNDERSTANDINGS
1392-135659-0016 TO DISCOVER AND OBSERVE THEM ANIMALS THEREFORE ARE NOT GUIDED IN THESE INFERENCES BY REASONING NEITHER ARE CHILDREN NEITHER ARE THE GENERALITY OF MANKIND IN THEIR ORDINARY ACTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
1392-135659-0017 NATURE MUST HAVE PROVIDED SOME OTHER PRINCIPLE OF MORE READY AND MORE GENERAL USE AND APPLICATION NOR CAN AN OPERATION OF SUCH IMMENSE CONSEQUENCE IN LIFE AS THAT OF INFERRING EFFECTS FROM CAUSES
1392-135659-0018 BE TRUSTED TO THE UNCERTAIN PROCESS OF REASONING AND ARGUMENTATION WERE THIS DOUBTFUL WITH REGARD TO MEN IT SEEMS TO ADMIT OF NO QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE BRUTE CREATION AND THE CONCLUSION BEING ONCE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN THE ONE
1392-135659-0019 WE HAVE A STRONG PRESUMPTION FROM ALL THE RULES OF ANALOGY THAT IT OUGHT TO BE UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION
1392-135659-0020 IN THAT PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH WE DENOMINATE BELIEF NO OTHER EXPLICATION CAN BE GIVEN OF THIS OPERATION IN ALL THE HIGHER AS WELL AS LOWER CLASSES OF SENSITIVE BEINGS WHICH FALL UNDER OUR NOTICE AND OBSERVATION
1392-135659-0021 IS DERIVED MERELY FROM CUSTOM IT MAY BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT MEN SO MUCH SURPASS ANIMALS IN REASONING AND ONE MAN SO MUCH SURPASSES ANOTHER HAS NOT THE SAME CUSTOM THE SAME INFLUENCE ON ALL
1392-135659-0022 WE SHALL HERE ENDEAVOUR BRIEFLY TO EXPLAIN THE GREAT DIFFERENCE IN HUMAN UNDERSTANDINGS AFTER WHICH THE REASON OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN AND ANIMALS
1392-135659-0023 AND HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE WE ACQUIRE A GENERAL HABIT BY WHICH WE ALWAYS TRANSFER THE KNOWN TO THE UNKNOWN AND CONCEIVE THE LATTER TO RESEMBLE THE FORMER BY MEANS OF THIS GENERAL HABITUAL PRINCIPLE
1392-135659-0024 WE REGARD EVEN ONE EXPERIMENT AS THE FOUNDATION OF REASONING AND EXPECT A SIMILAR EVENT WITH SOME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY WHERE THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN MADE ACCURATELY AND FREE FROM ALL FOREIGN CIRCUMSTANCES
1392-135659-0025 IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AS A MATTER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OBSERVE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THINGS AND AS ONE MAN MAY VERY MUCH SURPASS ANOTHER IN ATTENTION AND MEMORY AND OBSERVATION
1392-135659-0026 ONE MIND MAY BE MUCH LARGER THAN ANOTHER AND BETTER ABLE TO COMPREHEND THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF OBJECTS
1392-135659-0027 IS FREQUENTLY INVOLVED IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ARE FOREIGN AND EXTRINSIC THE SEPARATION OF IT OFTEN REQUIRES GREAT ATTENTION ACCURACY
1392-135659-0028 AND NOTHING IS MORE USUAL FROM HASTE OR A NARROWNESS OF MIND WHICH SEES NOT ON ALL SIDES
1392-135659-0029 THE MAN WHO HAS THE GREATER EXPERIENCE OR THE GREATER PROMPTITUDE OF SUGGESTING ANALOGIES WILL BE THE BETTER REASONER
1392-135659-0030 EDUCATION PASSION
1392-135659-0031 BOOKS AND CONVERSATION ENLARGE MUCH MORE THE SPHERE OF ONE MAN'S EXPERIENCE AND THOUGHT THAN THOSE OF ANOTHER IT WOULD BE EASY TO DISCOVER MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
1392-135659-0032 THERE ARE ALSO MANY PARTS OF IT WHICH THEY DERIVE FROM THE ORIGINAL HAND OF NATURE WHICH MUCH EXCEED THE SHARE OF CAPACITY THEY POSSESS ON ORDINARY OCCASIONS AND IN WHICH THEY IMPROVE LITTLE OR NOTHING
1392-135659-0033 BY THE LONGEST PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE THESE WE DENOMINATE INSTINCTS AND ARE SO APT TO ADMIRE AS SOMETHING VERY EXTRAORDINARY AND INEXPLICABLE BY ALL THE DISQUISITIONS OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING
1392-135659-0034 BUT OUR WONDER WILL PERHAPS CEASE OR DIMINISH WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL REASONING ITSELF WHICH WE POSSESS IN COMMON WITH BEASTS AND ON WHICH THE WHOLE CONDUCT OF LIFE DEPENDS
1392-135659-0035 IS NOTHING BUT A SPECIES OF INSTINCT OR MECHANICAL POWER THAT ACTS IN US UNKNOWN TO OURSELVES AND IN ITS CHIEF OPERATIONS IS NOT DIRECTED BY ANY SUCH RELATIONS OR COMPARISONS OF IDEAS AS ARE THE PROPER OBJECTS
1392-135659-0036 OF OUR INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES THOUGH THE INSTINCT BE DIFFERENT YET STILL IT IS AN INSTINCT
