5733-55099-0000 WELL THE ROCKS HAVE BEEN WHERE THEY ARE FOR MANY A YEAR AND THEY WILL WAIT OUR LEISURE PATIENTLY ENOUGH BUT MIDSUMMER AND THE HAY FIELD WILL NOT WAIT
5733-55099-0001 RATHER THAN THINGS WHICH ARE OLD AND WORN AND DEAD LET US LEAVE THE OLD STONES AND THE OLD BONES AND THE OLD SHELLS THE WRECKS OF ANCIENT WORLDS WHICH HAVE GONE DOWN INTO THE KINGDOM OF DEATH TO TEACH US THEIR GRAND LESSONS SOME OTHER DAY
5733-55099-0002 AND LET US LOOK NOW AT THE WORLD OF LIGHT AND LIFE AND BEAUTY WHICH BEGINS HERE AT THE OPEN DOOR AND STRETCHES AWAY OVER THE HAY FIELDS OVER THE WOODS OVER THE SOUTHERN MOORS OVER SUNNY FRANCE AND SUNNIER SPAIN
5733-55099-0003 AND OVER THE TROPIC SEAS DOWN TO THE EQUATOR AND THE PALM GROVES OF THE ETERNAL SUMMER IF WE CANNOT FIND SOMETHING EVEN AT STARTING FROM THE OPEN DOOR TO TEACH US ABOUT WHY AND HOW
5733-55099-0004 WE MUST BE VERY SHORT SIGHTED OR VERY SHALLOW HEARTED THERE IS THE OLD COCK STARLING SCREECHING IN THE EAVES BECAUSE HE WANTS TO FRIGHTEN US AWAY AND TAKE A WORM TO HIS CHILDREN WITHOUT OUR FINDING OUT WHEREABOUTS HIS HOLE IS
5733-55099-0005 HOW DOES HE KNOW THAT WE MIGHT HURT HIM AND HOW AGAIN DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT WE SHALL NOT HURT HIM WE WHO FOR FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS HAVE LET HIM AND HIS ANCESTORS BUILD UNDER THOSE EAVES IN PEACE HOW DID HE GET THAT QUANTITY OF HALF WIT
5733-55099-0006 THAT SORT OF STUPID CUNNING INTO HIS LITTLE BRAIN AND YET GET NO MORE
5733-55099-0007 DOES HE LABOUR ALL DAY LONG HUNTING FOR WORMS AND INSECTS FOR HIS CHILDREN WHILE HIS WIFE NURSES THEM IN THE NEST WHY TOO DID HE HELP HER TO BUILD THAT NEST WITH TOIL AND CARE THIS SPRING
5733-55099-0008 FOR THE SAKE OF A SET OF NESTLINGS WHO CAN BE OF NO GAIN OR USE TO HIM BUT ONLY TAKE THE FOOD OUT OF HIS MOUTH SIMPLY OUT OF WHAT SHALL I CALL IT MY CHILD LOVE THAT SAME SENSE OF LOVE AND DUTY
5733-55099-0009 COMING SURELY FROM THAT ONE FOUNTAIN OF ALL DUTY AND ALL LOVE WHICH MAKES YOUR FATHER WORK FOR YOU THAT THE MOTHER SHOULD TAKE CARE OF HER YOUNG IS WONDERFUL ENOUGH BUT THAT AT LEAST AMONG MANY BIRDS
5733-55099-0010 THE FATHER SHOULD HELP LIKEWISE IS AS YOU WILL FIND OUT AS YOU GROW OLDER MORE WONDERFUL FAR SO THERE ALREADY THE OLD STARLING HAS SET US TWO FRESH PUZZLES ABOUT HOW AND WHY NEITHER OF WHICH WE SHALL GET ANSWERED
5733-55099-0011 WHAT A GAY PICTURE HE IS PAINTING NOW WITH HIS LIGHT PENCILS FOR IN THEM REMEMBER AND NOT IN THE THINGS THEMSELVES THE COLOUR LIES SEE HOW WHERE THE HAY HAS BEEN ALREADY CARRIED
5733-55099-0012 HE FLOODS ALL THE SLOPES WITH YELLOW LIGHT MAKING THEM STAND OUT SHARP AGAINST THE BLACK SHADOWS OF THE WOOD WHILE WHERE THE GRASS IS STANDING STILL HE MAKES THE SHEETS OF SORREL FLOWER BLUSH ROSY RED
5733-55099-0013 OR DAPPLES THE FIELD WITH WHITE OXEYES BUT IS NOT THE SORREL ITSELF RED AND THE OXEYES WHITE WHAT COLOUR ARE THEY AT NIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS GONE DARK THAT IS NO COLOUR
5733-55099-0014 THE VERY GRASS IS NOT GREEN AT NIGHT OH BUT IT IS IF YOU LOOK AT IT WITH A LANTERN NO NO IT IS THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN WHICH HAPPENS TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE THE LEAVES LOOK GREEN
5733-55099-0015 THOUGH IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A GERANIUM LOOK RED NOT RED NO THE GERANIUM FLOWERS BY A LANTERN LOOK BLACK WHILE THE LEAVES LOOK GREEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME WE WILL TRY
5733-55099-0016 BUT WHY IS THAT WHY I CANNOT TELL AND HOW YOU HAD BEST ASK PROFESSOR TYNDALL IF YOU EVER HAVE THE HONOUR OF MEETING HIM BUT NOW HARK TO THE MOWING MACHINE HUMMING LIKE A GIANT NIGHT JAR
5733-55099-0017 COME UP AND LOOK AT IT AND SEE HOW SWIFT AND SMOOTH IT SHEARS THE LONG GRASS DOWN SO THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SWATHE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MERELY FALLEN FLAT AND YOU MUST MOVE IT BEFORE YOU FIND THAT IT HAS BEEN CUT OFF AH
5733-55099-0018 THERE IS A PROOF TO US OF WHAT MEN MAY DO IF THEY WILL ONLY LEARN THE LESSONS WHICH MADAM HOW CAN TEACH THEM THERE IS THAT BOY FRESH FROM THE NATIONAL SCHOOL CUTTING MORE GRASS IN A DAY THAN SIX STRONG MOWERS COULD HAVE CUT
5733-55099-0019 AND CUTTING IT BETTER TOO FOR THE MOWING MACHINE GOES SO MUCH NEARER TO THE GROUND THAN THE SCYTHE THAT WE GAIN BY IT TWO HUNDREDWEIGHT OF HAY ON EVERY ACRE AND SEE TOO HOW PERSEVERING OLD MADAM HOW WILL NOT STOP HER WORK
5733-55099-0020 THOUGH THE MACHINE HAS CUT OFF ALL THE GRASS WHICH SHE HAS BEEN MAKING FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS FOR AS FAST AS WE SHEAR IT OFF SHE MAKES IT GROW AGAIN THERE ARE FRESH BLADES HERE AT OUR FEET A FULL INCH LONG
5733-55099-0021 WHICH HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE LAST TWO DAYS FOR THE CATTLE WHEN THEY ARE TURNED IN NEXT WEEK BUT IF THE MACHINE CUTS ALL THE GRASS THE POOR MOWERS WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO NOT SO
5733-55099-0022 THEY ARE ALL BUSY ENOUGH ELSEWHERE THERE IS PLENTY OF OTHER WORK TO BE DONE THANK GOD AND WHOLESOMER AND EASIER WORK THAN MOWING WITH A BURNING SUN ON THEIR BACKS DRINKING GALLONS OF BEER AND GETTING FIRST HOT AND THEN COLD ACROSS THE LOINS
5733-55099-0023 TO CRIPPLE THEM IN THEIR OLD AGE YOU DELIGHT IN MACHINERY BECAUSE IT IS CURIOUS YOU SHOULD DELIGHT IN IT BESIDES BECAUSE IT DOES GOOD AND NOTHING BUT GOOD WHERE IT IS USED ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF LADY WHY WITH CARE
5733-55099-0024 WHICH THEY USED TO CATCH IN THE DRAUGHT AND DUST OF THE UNHEALTHIEST PLACE IN THE WHOLE PARISH WHICH IS THE OLD FASHIONED BARN'S FLOOR AND SO WE MAY HOPE IN FUTURE YEARS ALL HEAVY DRUDGERY AND DIRTY WORK
5733-55099-0025 A LIVE MANURE CART YES CHILD IF YOU HAD SEEN AS I HAVE SEEN IN FOREIGN LANDS POOR WOMEN HAGGARD DIRTY GROWN OLD BEFORE THEIR YOUTH WAS OVER
5733-55099-0026 TOILING UP HILL WITH BASKETS OF FOUL MANURE UPON THEIR BACKS YOU WOULD HAVE SAID AS I HAVE SAID OH FOR MADAM HOW TO CURE THAT IGNORANCE OH FOR LADY WHY TO CURE THAT BARBARISM
5733-55099-0027 OH THAT MADAM HOW WOULD TEACH THEM THAT MACHINERY MUST ALWAYS BE CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN THAN HUMAN MUSCLES AND NERVES OH THAT LADY WHY WOULD TEACH THEM THAT A WOMAN IS THE MOST PRECIOUS THING ON EARTH AND THAT IF SHE BE TURNED INTO A BEAST OF BURDEN
5733-55099-0028 LADY WHY AND MADAM HOW LIKEWISE WILL SURELY AVENGE THE WRONGS OF THEIR HUMAN SISTER THERE YOU DO NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND I DO NOT CARE THAT YOU SHOULD
5733-55099-0029 IT IS GOOD FOR LITTLE FOLK THAT BIG FOLK SHOULD NOW AND THEN TALK OVER THEIR HEADS AS THE SAYING IS AND MAKE THEM FEEL HOW IGNORANT THEY ARE AND HOW MANY SOLEMN AND EARNEST QUESTIONS THERE ARE IN THE WORLD ON WHICH THEY MUST MAKE UP THEIR MINDS SOME DAY THOUGH NOT YET
5733-55099-0030 BUT NOW WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE HAY OR RATHER DO YOU AND THE REST GO AND PLAY IN THE HAY AND GATHER IT UP BUILD FORTS OF IT
5733-55099-0031 STORM THEM PULL THEM DOWN BUILD THEM UP AGAIN SHOUT LAUGH AND SCREAM TILL YOU ARE HOT AND TIRED YOU WILL PLEASE MADAM HOW THEREBY AND LADY WHY LIKEWISE HOW BECAUSE MADAM HOW NATURALLY WANTS HER WORK TO SUCCEED
5733-55099-0032 AND SHE IS AT WORK NOW MAKING YOU MAKING ME OF COURSE MAKING A MAN OF YOU OUT OF A BOY AND THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY THE LIFE BLOOD WHICH RUNS THROUGH AND THROUGH YOU AND THE MORE YOU LAUGH AND SHOUT
5733-55099-0033 THE MORE PURE AIR WILL PASS INTO YOUR BLOOD AND MAKE IT RED AND HEALTHY AND THE MORE YOU ROMP AND PLAY UNLESS YOU OVERTIRE YOURSELF THE QUICKER WILL THAT BLOOD FLOW THROUGH ALL YOUR LIMBS TO MAKE BONE AND MUSCLE
5733-55099-0034 BUT WHY DOES LADY WHY LIKE TO SEE US PLAY SHE LIKES TO SEE YOU HAPPY AS SHE LIKES TO SEE THE TREES AND BIRDS HAPPY FOR SHE KNOWS WELL THAT THERE IS NO FOOD NOR MEDICINE EITHER LIKE HAPPINESS
5733-55099-0035 IF PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY ENOUGH THEY ARE OFTEN TEMPTED TO DO MANY WRONG DEEDS AND TO THINK MANY WRONG THOUGHTS AND IF BY GOD'S GRACE THEY KNOW THE LAWS OF LADY WHY AND KEEP FROM SIN STILL
5733-55099-0036 UNHAPPINESS IF IT GOES ON TOO LONG WEARS THEM OUT BODY AND MIND AND THEY GROW ILL AND DIE OF BROKEN HEARTS AND BROKEN BRAINS MY CHILD AND SO AT LAST POOR SOULS FIND REST BENEATH THE CROSS
5733-55099-0037 CHILDREN TOO WHO ARE UNHAPPY CHILDREN WHO ARE BULLIED AND FRIGHTENED AND KEPT DULL AND SILENT NEVER THRIVE THEIR BODIES DO NOT THRIVE FOR THEY GROW UP WEAK THEIR MINDS DO NOT THRIVE FOR THEY GROW UP DULL THEIR SOULS DO NOT THRIVE
5733-55099-0038 FOR THEY LEARN MEAN SLY SLAVISH WAYS WHICH GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD EVER LEARN WELL SAID THE WISE MAN THE HUMAN PLANT LIKE THE VEGETABLES CAN ONLY FLOWER IN SUNSHINE SO DO YOU GO AND ENJOY YOURSELF IN THE SUNSHINE
5733-55099-0039 BUT REMEMBER THIS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPINESS IS THEN IF YOU WISH TO PLEASE LADY WHY AND LADY WHY'S LORD AND KING LIKEWISE YOU WILL NEVER PASS A LITTLE CHILD WITHOUT TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPIER EVEN BY A PASSING SMILE
5733-55099-0040 AND NOW BE OFF AND PLAY IN THE HAY AND COME BACK TO ME WHEN YOU ARE TIRED
5733-55099-0041 AS YOU WOULD FIND IF YOU TRIED TO SEE WHAT MAKES THAT MIDSUMMER HUM OF WHICH THE HAYMAKERS ARE SO FOND BECAUSE IT PROMISES FAIR WEATHER WHY IT IS ONLY THE GNATS AND FLIES ONLY THE GNATS AND FLIES
5733-55099-0042 YOU MIGHT STUDY THOSE GNATS AND FLIES FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE WITHOUT FINDING OUT ALL OR MORE THAN A VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM I WISH I KNEW HOW THEY MOVE THOSE TINY WINGS OF THEIRS A THOUSAND TIMES IN A SECOND I DARE SAY SOME OF THEM
5733-55099-0043 I WISH I KNEW HOW FAR THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE HAPPY FOR HAPPY THEY MUST BE WHETHER THEY KNOW IT OR NOT I WISH I KNEW HOW THEY LIVE AT ALL I WISH I EVEN KNEW HOW MANY SORTS THERE ARE HUMMING ROUND US AT THIS MOMENT HOW MANY KINDS
5733-55099-0044 BUT WHY SHOULD THERE BE SO MANY KINDS OF LIVING THINGS WOULD NOT ONE OR TWO HAVE DONE JUST AS WELL
5733-55099-0045 WHY SHOULD THERE NOT HAVE BEEN ONLY ONE SORT OF BUTTERFLY AND HE ONLY OF ONE COLOUR A PLAIN BROWN OR A PLAIN WHITE AND WHY SHOULD THERE BE SO MANY SORTS OF BIRDS ALL ROBBING THE GARDEN AT ONCE
5733-55099-0046 THRUSHES AND BLACKBIRDS AND SPARROWS AND CHAFFINCHES AND GREENFINCHES AND BULLFINCHES AND TOMTITS AND THERE ARE FOUR KINDS OF TOMTITS ROUND HERE REMEMBER BUT WE MAY GO ON WITH SUCH TALK FOR EVER
5733-55099-0047 HOWEVER THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH MADAM HOW SEEMS INCLINED TO ANSWER JUST NOW WHICH IS ALMOST AS DEEP AND MYSTERIOUS WHAT HOW ALL THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BECAME DIFFERENT OH
5733-55099-0048 DO TELL ME NOT I YOU MUST BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING BEFORE YOU CAN END AT THE END OR EVEN MAKE ONE STEP TOWARDS THE END
5733-55099-0049 YOU MUST LEARN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THINGS BEFORE YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW THOSE DIFFERENCES CAME ABOUT YOU MUST LEARN MADAM HOW'S ALPHABET BEFORE YOU CAN READ HER BOOK AND MADAM HOW'S ALPHABET OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS IS SPECIES
5733-55099-0050 KINDS OF THINGS YOU MUST SEE WHICH ARE LIKE AND WHICH UNLIKE WHAT THEY ARE LIKE IN AND WHAT THEY ARE UNLIKE IN YOU ARE BEGINNING TO DO THAT WITH YOUR COLLECTION OF BUTTERFLIES YOU LIKE TO ARRANGE THEM
5733-55099-0051 AND THOSE THAT ARE MOST LIKE NEAREST TO EACH OTHER AND TO COMPARE THEM YOU MUST DO THAT WITH THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BEFORE YOU CAN READ ONE PAGE OF MADAM HOW'S NATURAL HISTORY BOOK RIGHTLY
5733-55099-0052 BUT IT WILL TAKE SO MUCH TIME AND SO MUCH TROUBLE GOD GRANT THAT YOU MAY NOT SPEND MORE TIME ON WORSE MATTERS AND TAKE MORE TROUBLE OVER THINGS WHICH WILL PROFIT YOU FAR LESS BUT SO IT MUST BE WILLY NILLY
5733-55099-0053 YOU MUST LEARN THE ALPHABET IF YOU MEAN TO READ AND YOU MUST LEARN THE VALUE OF THE FIGURES BEFORE YOU CAN DO A SUM WHY WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF ANY ONE WHO SAT DOWN TO PLAY AT CARDS FOR MONEY TOO WHICH I HOPE AND TRUST YOU NEVER WILL DO
5733-55099-0054 BEFORE HE KNEW THE NAMES OF THE CARDS AND WHICH COUNTED HIGHEST AND TOOK THE OTHER OF COURSE HE WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH JUST AS FOOLISH ARE THOSE WHO MAKE UP THEORIES AS THEY CALL THEM ABOUT THIS WORLD AND HOW IT WAS MADE
5733-55099-0055 AH YES THE OLD STORY MY CHILD WAS NOT THE EARTH ALWAYS JUST WHAT IT IS NOW LET US SEE FOR OURSELVES WHETHER THIS WAS ALWAYS A HAY FIELD HOW
5733-55099-0056 JUST PICK OUT ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLANTS AND FLOWERS YOU CAN FIND ROUND US HERE HOW MANY DO YOU THINK THERE ARE OH THERE SEEM TO BE FOUR OR FIVE
5733-55099-0057 JUST AS THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR KINDS OF FLIES IN THE AIR PICK THEM CHILD AND COUNT LET US HAVE FACTS HOW MANY WHAT A DOZEN ALREADY YES AND HERE IS ANOTHER AND ANOTHER WHY
5733-55099-0058 AND A LITTLE STITCHWORT AND PIGNUT AND MOUSE EAR HAWKWEED TOO WHICH NOBODY WANTS WHY
5733-55099-0059 WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOOK OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY FENCE AT THE MOORS AND WOODS THEY ARE FOREST WILD WALD AS THE GERMANS WOULD CALL IT INSIDE THE FENCE IS FIELD FELD AS THE GERMANS WOULD CALL IT
5733-55099-0060 GUESS WHY IS IT BECAUSE THE TREES INSIDE HAVE BEEN FELLED WELL SOME SAY SO WHO KNOW MORE THAN I BUT NOW GO OVER THE FENCE AND SEE HOW MANY OF THESE PLANTS YOU CAN FIND ON THE MOOR
5733-55099-0061 OH I THINK I KNOW
5733-55099-0062 THERE ARE HARDLY ANY GRASSES ON THE MOOR SAVE DEER'S HAIR AND GLADE GRASS
5733-55099-0063 AT ALL EVENTS THE PLANTS OUTSIDE ARE ON THE WHOLE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE HAY FIELD OF COURSE THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE FIELD LOOK GREEN AND THE MOOR BROWN NOT A DOUBT
5733-55099-0064 THEY ARE SO DIFFERENT THAT THEY LOOK LIKE BITS OF TWO DIFFERENT CONTINENTS SCRAMBLING OVER THE FENCE IS LIKE SCRAMBLING OUT OF EUROPE INTO AUSTRALIA NOW HOW WAS THAT DIFFERENCE MADE THINK DON'T GUESS BUT THINK
5733-55099-0065 WHY DOES THE RICH GRASS COME UP TO THE BANK AND YET NOT SPREAD BEYOND IT I SUPPOSE BECAUSE IT CANNOT GET OVER NOT GET OVER WOULD NOT THE WIND BLOW THE SEEDS AND THE BIRDS CARRY THEM THEY DO GET OVER
5733-55099-0066 IN MILLIONS I DON'T DOUBT EVERY SUMMER THEN WHY DO THEY NOT GROW THINK IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE SOIL INSIDE AND OUT A VERY GOOD GUESS BUT GUESSES ARE NO USE WITHOUT FACTS
5733-55099-0067 LOOK OH I REMEMBER NOW I KNOW NOW THE SOIL OF THE FIELD IS BROWN LIKE THE GARDEN
5733-55099-0068 SO PERHAPS THE TOP SOILS WERE ONCE BOTH ALIKE I KNOW WELL AND WHAT
5733-55099-0069 I WANT YOU TO LOOK AND THINK I WANT EVERY ONE TO LOOK AND THINK HALF THE MISERY IN THE WORLD COMES FIRST FROM NOT LOOKING AND THEN FROM NOT THINKING AND I DO NOT WANT YOU TO BE MISERABLE
5733-55099-0070 BUT SHALL I BE MISERABLE IF I DO NOT FIND OUT SUCH LITTLE THINGS AS THIS YOU WILL BE MISERABLE IF YOU DO NOT LEARN TO UNDERSTAND LITTLE THINGS BECAUSE THEN YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND GREAT THINGS WHEN YOU MEET THEM
5733-55099-0071 WHAT MEN CALL DREAMERS AND BIGOTS AND FANATICS CAUSING MISERY TO THEMSELVES AND TO ALL WHO DEAL WITH THEM SO I SAY AGAIN THINK WELL
5733-55099-0072 WELL DONE BUT WHY DO YOU THINK SO
5733-55099-0073 AND THE BROWN SOIL ONLY GOES UP TO IT WELL THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE COMMON SENSE NOW YOU WILL NOT SAY ANY MORE AS THE COWS OR THE BUTTERFLIES MIGHT THAT THE HAY FIELD WAS ALWAYS THERE
5733-55099-0074 AND HOW DID MEN CHANGE THE SOIL BY TILLING IT WITH THE PLOUGH TO SWEETEN IT AND MANURING IT TO MAKE IT RICH AND THEN DID ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL GRASSES GROW UP OF THEMSELVES YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THEY MOST LIKELY DID NOT
5733-55099-0075 YES WELL THEN DO RICH GRASSES COME UP ON THEM NOW THAT THEY ARE BROKEN UP OH NO NOTHING BUT GROUNDSEL AND A FEW WEEDS
5733-55099-0076 BUT THIS LAND WAS TILLED FOR CORN FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS I BELIEVE AND JUST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT WAS LAID DOWN IN GRASS THAT IS SOWN WITH GRASS SEEDS AND WHERE DID MEN GET THE GRASS SEEDS FROM
5733-55099-0077 AH THAT IS A LONG STORY AND ONE THAT SHOWS OUR FOREFATHERS THOUGH THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT RAILROADS OR ELECTRICITY WERE NOT SUCH SIMPLETONS AS SOME FOLKS THINK
5733-55099-0078 AND MANY OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AND THEN THEY SAVED THE SEEDS OF THOSE FATTENING WILD GRASSES AND SOWED THEM IN FRESH SPOTS OFTEN THEY MADE MISTAKES THEY WERE CARELESS AND GOT WEEDS AMONG THE SEED
5733-55099-0079 LIKE THE BUTTERCUPS WHICH DO SO MUCH HARM TO THIS PASTURE OR THEY SOWED ON SOIL WHICH WOULD NOT SUIT THE SEED AND IT DIED BUT AT LAST
5733-55099-0080 AFTER MANY FAILURES THEY HAVE GROWN SO CAREFUL AND SO CLEVER THAT YOU MAY SEND TO CERTAIN SHOPS SAYING WHAT SORT OF SOIL YOURS IS
5733-55099-0081 AND THEY WILL SEND YOU JUST THE SEEDS WHICH WILL GROW THERE AND NO OTHER AND THEN YOU HAVE A GOOD PASTURE FOR AS LONG AS YOU CHOOSE TO KEEP IT GOOD AND HOW IS IT KEPT GOOD
5733-55099-0082 DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ALL THAT AWAY WITHOUT PUTTING ANYTHING IN ITS PLACE WHY NOT IF I TOOK ALL THE BUTTER OUT OF THE CHURN WHAT MUST I DO IF I WANT MORE BUTTER STILL
5733-55099-0083 IF I WANT MORE GRASS TO GROW I MUST PUT ON THE SOIL MORE OF WHAT GRASS IS MADE OF BUT THE BUTTER DON'T GROW AND THE GRASS DOES WHAT DOES THE GRASS GROW IN THE SOIL YES
5733-55099-0084 JUST AS THE BUTTER GROWS IN THE CHURN SO YOU MUST PUT FRESH GRASS STUFF CONTINUALLY INTO THE SOIL AS YOU PUT FRESH CREAM INTO THE CHURN YOU HAVE HEARD THE FARM MEN SAY THAT CROP HAS TAKEN A GOOD DEAL OUT OF THE LAND
5733-55099-0085 YES THEN THEY SPOKE EXACT TRUTH WHAT WILL THAT HAY TURN INTO BY CHRISTMAS CAN'T YOU TELL INTO MILK OF COURSE WHICH YOU WILL DRINK AND INTO HORSEFLESH TOO WHICH YOU WILL USE
5733-55099-0086 USE HORSEFLESH NOT EAT IT NO WE HAVE NOT GOT AS FAR AS THAT WE DID NOT EVEN MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO TASTE THE CAMBRIDGE DONKEY BUT EVERY TIME THE HORSE DRAWS THE CARRIAGE HE USES UP SO MUCH MUSCLE
5733-55099-0087 AND THAT HAY AND CORN MUST BE PUT BACK AGAIN INTO THE LAND BY MANURE
5733-55099-0088 FOR ONE CANNOT EAT ONE'S CAKE AND KEEP IT TOO AND NO MORE CAN ONE EAT ONE'S GRASS SO THIS FIELD IS A TRULY WONDERFUL PLACE IT IS NO UGLY PILE OF BRICK AND MORTAR
5733-55099-0089 WELL AND THIS HAY FIELD IS A MANUFACTORY
5733-55099-0090 AND THEREFORE IT IS A FLESH AND MILK MANUFACTORY WE MUST PUT INTO IT EVERY YEAR YARD STUFF TANK STUFF GUANO BONES AND ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING OF THAT KIN
5733-55099-0091 THAT MADAM HOW MAY COOK IT FOR US INTO GRASS AND COOK THE GRASS AGAIN INTO MILK AND MEAT BUT IF WE DON'T GIVE MADAM HOW MATERIAL TO WORK ON WE CANNOT EXPECT HER TO WORK FOR US AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN THEN
5733-55099-0092 SHE WILL SET TO WORK FOR HERSELF THE RICH GRASSES WILL DWINDLE FOR WANT OF AMMONIA THAT IS SMELLING SALTS AND THE RICH CLOVERS FOR WANT OF PHOSPHATES
5733-55099-0093 THAT IS BONE EARTH AND IN THEIR PLACES WILL COME OVER THE BANK THE OLD WEEDS AND GRASS OFF THE MOOR WHICH HAVE NOT ROOM TO GET IN NOW BECAUSE THE GROUND IS COVETED ALREADY THEY WANT NO AMMONIA NOR PHOSPHATES
