1271-133279-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN LIBERTY OF THE PRESS IN THE UNITED STATES CHAPTER SUMMARY DIFFICULTY OF RESTRAINING THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS
1271-133279-0001 PARTICULAR REASONS WHICH SOME NATIONS HAVE TO CHERISH THIS LIBERTY THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE AS IT IS UNDERSTOOD IN AMERICA
1271-133279-0002 VIOLENT LANGUAGE OF THE PERIODICAL PRESS IN THE UNITED STATES PROPENSITIES OF THE PERIODICAL PRESS ILLUSTRATED BY THE UNITED STATES
1271-133279-0003 IN ANOTHER PART OF THIS WORK I SHALL ATTEMPT TO DETERMINATE THE DEGREE OF INFLUENCE WHICH THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS HAS EXERCISED UPON CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE UNITED STATES
1271-133279-0004 AND TO POINT OUT THE DIRECTION WHICH IT HAS GIVEN TO THE IDEAS AS WELL AS THE TONE WHICH IT HAS IMPARTED TO THE CHARACTER AND THE FEELINGS OF THE ANGLO AMERICANS
1271-133279-0005 BUT AT PRESENT I PURPOSE SIMPLY TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS IN THE POLITICAL WORLD I CONFESS THAT I DO NOT ENTERTAIN THAT FIRM AND COMPLETE ATTACHMENT TO THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS
1271-133279-0006 WHICH THINGS THAT ARE SUPREMELY GOOD IN THEIR VERY NATURE ARE WONT TO EXCITE IN THE MIND AND I APPROVE OF IT MORE FROM A RECOLLECTION OF THE EVILS IT PREVENTS THAN FROM A CONSIDERATION OF THE ADVANTAGES IT ENSURES
1271-133279-0007 IF ANY ONE COULD POINT OUT AN INTERMEDIATE AND YET A TENABLE POSITION BETWEEN THE COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE AND THE ENTIRE SUBJECTION OF THE PUBLIC EXPRESSION OF OPINION I SHOULD PERHAPS BE INCLINED TO ADOPT IT
1271-133279-0008 BUT THE DIFFICULTY IS TO DISCOVER THIS POSITION IF IT IS YOUR INTENTION TO CORRECT THE ABUSES OF UNLICENSED PRINTING AND TO RESTORE THE USE OF ORDERLY LANGUAGE
1271-133279-0009 YOU MAY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TRY THE OFFENDER BY A JURY BUT IF THE JURY ACQUITS HIM THE OPINION WHICH WAS THAT OF A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL BECOMES THE OPINION OF THE COUNTRY AT LARGE
1271-133279-0010 TOO MUCH AND TOO LITTLE HAS THEREFORE HITHERTO BEEN DONE IF YOU PROCEED YOU MUST BRING THE DELINQUENT BEFORE A COURT OF PERMANENT JUDGES
1271-133279-0011 BUT EVEN HERE THE CAUSE MUST BE HEARD BEFORE IT CAN BE DECIDED AND THE VERY PRINCIPLES WHICH NO BOOK WOULD HAVE VENTURED TO AVOW ARE BLAZONED FORTH IN THE PLEADINGS
1271-133279-0012 AND WHAT WAS OBSCURELY HINTED AT IN A SINGLE COMPOSITION IS THEN REPEATED IN A MULTITUDE OF OTHER PUBLICATIONS THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH A THOUGHT IS EMBODIED IS THE MERE CARCASS OF THE THOUGHT
1271-133279-0013 AND NOT THE IDEA ITSELF TRIBUNALS MAY CONDEMN THE FORM BUT THE SENSE AND SPIRIT OF THE WORK IS TOO SUBTLE FOR THEIR AUTHORITY TOO MUCH HAS STILL BEEN DONE TO RECEDE
1271-133279-0014 TOO LITTLE TO ATTAIN YOUR END YOU MUST THEREFORE PROCEED IF YOU ESTABLISH A CENSORSHIP OF THE PRESS THE TONGUE OF THE PUBLIC SPEAKER WILL STILL MAKE ITSELF HEARD
1271-133279-0015 AND YOU HAVE ONLY INCREASED THE MISCHIEF THE POWERS OF THOUGHT DO NOT RELY LIKE THE POWERS OF PHYSICAL STRENGTH UPON THE NUMBER OF THEIR MECHANICAL AGENTS
1271-133279-0016 NOR CAN A HOST OF AUTHORS BE RECKONED LIKE THE TROOPS WHICH COMPOSE AN ARMY ON THE CONTRARY THE AUTHORITY OF A PRINCIPLE IS OFTEN INCREASED BY THE SMALLNESS OF THE NUMBER OF MEN
1271-133279-0017 ORATORS AND IF IT BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK FREELY IN ANY PUBLIC PLACE THE CONSEQUENCE IS THE SAME AS IF FREE SPEAKING WAS ALLOWED IN EVERY VILLAGE
1271-133279-0018 THE LIBERTY OF DISCOURSE MUST THEREFORE BE DESTROYED AS WELL AS THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS THIS IS THE NECESSARY TERM OF YOUR EFFORTS
1271-133279-0019 BUT IF YOUR OBJECT WAS TO REPRESS THE ABUSES OF LIBERTY THEY HAVE BROUGHT YOU TO THE FEET OF A DESPOT YOU HAVE BEEN LED FROM THE EXTREME OF INDEPENDENCE TO THE EXTREME OF SUBJECTION
1271-133279-0020 WITHOUT MEETING WITH A SINGLE TENABLE POSITION FOR SHELTER OR REPOSE THERE ARE CERTAIN NATIONS WHICH HAVE PECULIAR REASONS FOR CHERISHING THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS
1271-133279-0021 INDEPENDENTLY OF THE GENERAL MOTIVES WHICH I HAVE JUST POINTED OUT FOR IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHICH PROFESS TO ENJOY THE PRIVILEGES OF FREEDOM EVERY INDIVIDUAL AGENT OF THE GOVERNMENT MAY VIOLATE THE LAWS WITH IMPUNITY
1271-133279-0022 SINCE THOSE WHOM HE OPPRESSES CANNOT PROSECUTE HIM BEFORE THE COURTS OF JUSTICE IN THIS CASE THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS IS NOT MERELY A GUARANTEE BUT IT IS THE ONLY GUARANTEE OF THEIR LIBERTY
1271-133279-0023 AND THEIR SECURITY WHICH THE CITIZENS POSSESS IF THE RULERS OF THESE NATIONS PROPOSE TO ABOLISH THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE PRESS THE PEOPLE WOULD BE JUSTIFIED IN SAYING
1271-133279-0024 BUT IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE DOCTRINE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE OSTENSIBLY PREVAILS THE CENSORSHIP OF THE PRESS IS NOT ONLY DANGEROUS BUT IT IS ABSURD
1271-133279-0025 WHEN THE RIGHT OF EVERY CITIZEN TO CO OPERATE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF SOCIETY IS ACKNOWLEDGED EVERY CITIZEN MUST BE PRESUMED TO POSSESS THE POWER OF DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT OPINIONS OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES
1271-133279-0026 JUST AS THE CENSORSHIP OF THE PRESS AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE ARE TWO THINGS WHICH ARE IRRECONCILABLY OPPOSED AND WHICH CANNOT LONG BE RETAINED AMONG THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE SAME PEOPLE
1271-133279-0027 THE FIRST NEWSPAPER OVER WHICH I CAST MY EYES UPON MY ARRIVAL IN AMERICA CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE
1271-133279-0028 IN ALL THIS AFFAIR THE LANGUAGE OF JACKSON HAS BEEN THAT OF A HEARTLESS DESPOT SOLELY OCCUPIED WITH THE PRESERVATION OF HIS OWN AUTHORITY AMBITION IS HIS CRIME
1271-133279-0029 AND IT WILL BE HIS PUNISHMENT TOO INTRIGUE IS HIS NATIVE ELEMENT AND INTRIGUE WILL CONFOUND HIS TRICKS AND WILL DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS POWER HE GOVERNS BY MEANS OF CORRUPTION
1271-133279-0030 AND HIS IMMORAL PRACTICES WILL REDOUND TO HIS SHAME AND CONFUSION HIS CONDUCT IN THE POLITICAL ARENA HAS BEEN THAT OF A SHAMELESS
1271-133279-0031 HE SUCCEEDED AT THE TIME BUT THE HOUR OF RETRIBUTION APPROACHES AND HE WILL BE OBLIGED TO DISGORGE HIS WINNINGS TO THROW ASIDE HIS FALSE DICE
1271-133279-0032 AND TO END HIS DAYS IN SOME RETIREMENT WHERE HE MAY CURSE HIS MADNESS AT HIS LEISURE FOR REPENTANCE IS A VIRTUE WITH WHICH HIS HEART IS LIKELY TO REMAIN FOREVER UNACQUAINTED
1271-133279-0033 AND THE GENERAL SENSE OF CONSEQUENT EVIL WHICH PREVAIL IN THAT COUNTRY AND IT IS THEREFORE SUPPOSED THAT AS SOON AS SOCIETY HAS RESUMED A CERTAIN DEGREE OF COMPOSURE
1271-133279-0034 THE PRESS WILL ABANDON ITS PRESENT VEHEMENCE I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE ABOVE CAUSES EXPLAIN THE REASON OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ASCENDENCY IT HAS ACQUIRED OVER THE NATION
1271-133279-0035 BUT THAT THEY DO NOT EXERCISE MUCH INFLUENCE UPON THE TONE OF ITS LANGUAGE THE PERIODICAL PRESS APPEARS TO ME TO BE ACTUATED BY PASSIONS AND PROPENSITIES
1271-133279-0036 INDEPENDENT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH IT IS PLACED AND THE PRESENT POSITION OF AMERICA CORROBORATES THIS OPINION AMERICA IS PERHAPS AT THIS MOMENT
1271-133279-0037 IT CONSTITUTES A SINGULAR POWER SO STRANGELY COMPOSED OF MINGLED GOOD AND EVIL THAT IT IS AT THE SAME TIME INDISPENSABLE TO THE EXISTENCE OF FREEDOM AND NEARLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC ORDER
1271-133279-0038 ITS POWER IS CERTAINLY MUCH GREATER IN FRANCE THAN IN THE UNITED STATES THOUGH NOTHING IS MORE RARE IN THE LATTER COUNTRY THAN TO HEAR OF A PROSECUTION HAVING BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST IT
