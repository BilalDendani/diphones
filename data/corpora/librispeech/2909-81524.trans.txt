2909-81524-0009 ONE OF THE QUIETLY HUMOROUS FIGURES WITH WHICH HE RELIEVES HIS MORE SERIOUS COMPANY BERNARD WITH WHOM THE REFINEMENTS OF A MAN OF FASHION IN THE PARISIAN WORLD BY NO MEANS DISGUISE A POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE CULTIVATED BY WIDE READING
2909-81524-0010 HAS HAD THOUGHTS DURING HIS TEDIOUS STAY AT LA SAVINIERE OF WRITING A HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH
2909-81524-0011 IS BENT ON PROVIDING HIM WITH A WIFE AND INDEED HAS ONE IN VIEW THE ACCOMPLISHED BERNARD WITH MANY GRACES OF PERSON BY HIS OWN CONFESSION TAKES NOTHING SERIOUSLY AS TO THAT MATTER OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
2909-81524-0012 MAKES US SEE THE PLACE AND THE ENTERPRISE HAS AT LEAST SUFFICIENT INTEREST TO KEEP BERNARD IN THE COUNTRY WHICH THE YOUNG PARISIAN DETESTS THIS PIQUANT EPISODE OF MY LIFE HE WRITES SEEMS TO ME TO BE REALLY DESERVING OF STUDY

2909-81524-0014 SO OFTEN ERRING OR CORRUPT IS A MAN OF SCRUPULOUS HONOUR
2909-81524-0015 AT LEAST IN THIS FIRST PART OF HIS JOURNAL
2909-81524-0016 OF UNDERSTANDING AND BEING TOUCHED BY THE PRESENCE OF GREAT MATTERS IN SPITE OF THAT HAPPY LIGHTNESS OF HEART SO JEALOUSLY FENCED ABOUT
2909-81524-0017 AS HE IS WORTHY TO BE BY THE SERIOUS THE GENEROUS INFLUENCE OF THINGS IN PROPORTION TO HIS IMMENSE WORLDLY STRENGTH IS HIS CAPACITY FOR THE IMMENSE PITY WHICH BREAKS HIS HEART
2909-81524-0018 AS IF IT WERE INDEED A THING OF ORDINARY EXISTENCE
2909-81524-0019 YOUR FATHER I OBSERVED HAD A STRONG PREDILECTION FOR THE AGE OF LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH MY FATHER LIVED IN THAT AGE SHE ANSWERED GRAVELY AND AS I LOOKED AT HER WITH SURPRISE
2909-81524-0020 THEN SEATING HERSELF ON THE STEP OF THE BOOK CASE SHE SAID I MUST EXPLAIN MY FATHER TO YOU SHE WAS HALF A MINUTE COLLECTING HER THOUGHTS THEN SPEAKING WITH AN EXPANSION OF MANNER NOT HABITUAL WITH HER
2909-81524-0021 THAT MIGHT SEEM A SHADE TOO SERIOUS FOR LIPS SO YOUTHFUL MY FATHER SHE PROCEEDED DIED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A WOUND HE HAD RECEIVED AT PATAY THAT MAY SHOW YOU THAT HE LOVED HIS COUNTRY BUT HE WAS NO LOVER OF HIS OWN AGE
2909-81524-0022 HE POSSESSED IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE THE LOVE OF ORDER AND ORDER WAS A THING NOWHERE TO BE SEEN HE HAD A HORROR OF DISORDER AND HE SAW IT EVERYWHERE IN THOSE LAST YEARS ESPECIALLY HIS REVERENCE HIS BELIEFS HIS TASTES
2909-81524-0023 ALL ALIKE WERE RUFFLED TO THE POINT OF ACTUAL SUFFERING
2909-81524-0024 ROSE MALLOWS IMMORTELLES ROSE PINKS IN SHORT WHAT PEOPLE CALL PARSONAGE FLOWERS
2909-81524-0025 YOU SEE TOO THAT ALL OUR FURNITURE FROM PRESSES AND SIDEBOARDS DOWN TO OUR LITTLE TABLES AND OUR ARM CHAIRS IS IN THE SEVEREST STYLE OF LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH MY FATHER DID NOT APPRECIATE THE DAINTY RESEARCH OF OUR MODERN LUXURY
2909-81524-0026 IT WAS THUS THAT MY FATHER ENDEAVOURED BY THE VERY ASPECT AND ARRANGEMENT OF OUTWARD THINGS TO PROMOTE IN HIMSELF THE IMAGINARY PRESENCE OF THE EPOCH IN WHICH HIS THOUGHTS DELIGHTED AS FOR MYSELF
2909-81524-0027 NEED I TELL YOU THAT I WAS THE CONFIDANT OF THAT FATHER SO WELL BELOVED A CONFIDANT TOUCHED BY HIS SORROWS FULL OF INDIGNATION AT HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS CHARMED BY HIS CONSOLATIONS HERE PRECISELY SURROUNDED BY THOSE BOOKS WHICH WE READ TOGETHER
2909-81524-0028 IT IS HERE THAT I HAVE PASSED THE PLEASANTEST HOURS OF MY YOUTH
2909-81524-0029 THE QUIET LIFE ITS BLISSFUL HOURS OF LEISURE WELL SECURED FOR THE FRENCH LANGUAGE IN ITS BEAUTY AND PURITY THE DELICATE THE NOBLE URBANITY WHICH WAS THEN THE HONOUR AND THE SPECIAL MARK OF OUR COUNTRY BUT HAS CEASED TO BE SO
2909-81524-0030 SHE PAUSED WITH A LITTLE CONFUSION AS I THOUGHT AT THE WARMTH OF HER LAST WORDS
2909-81524-0031 YOU HAVE EXPLAINED I SAID AN IMPRESSION WHICH I HAVE EXPERIENCED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN MY VISITS HERE AND WHICH HAS SOMETIMES REACHED THE INTENSITY OF AN ACTUAL ILLUSION THOUGH A VERY AGREEABLE ONE
2909-81524-0032 THE LOOK OF YOUR HOUSE ITS STYLE ITS TONE AND KEEPING CARRIED ME TWO CENTURIES BACK SO COMPLETELY THAT I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
2909-81524-0033 MOST TRULY MADEMOISELLE I SAID THE AGE WHICH YOU REGRET HAD ITS RARE MERITS MERITS WHICH I APPRECIATE AS YOU DO BUT THEN NEED ONE SAY THAT THAT SOCIETY SO REGULAR SO CHOICE IN APPEARANCE HAD LIKE OUR OWN
2909-81524-0034 BELOW THE SURFACE ITS TROUBLES ITS DISORDERS
2909-81524-0035 BUT I HAVE READ ENOUGH OF IT TO KNOW THAT MY FRIENDS IN THAT PAST AGE HAD
2909-81524-0036 THEIR WEAKNESSES THEIR MISTAKES BUT AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY TO ME ALL THAT DID BUT PASS OVER A GROUND OF WHAT WAS SOLID AND SERIOUS WHICH ALWAYS DISCOVERED ITSELF AGAIN ANEW THERE WERE GREAT FAULTS THEN
2909-81524-0037 BUT THERE WERE ALSO GREAT REPENTANCES THERE WAS A CERTAIN HIGHER REGION TO WHICH EVERYTHING CONDUCTED EVEN WHAT AS EVIL SHE BLUSHED DEEPLY THEN RISING A LITTLE SUDDENLY A LONG SPEECH SHE SAID FORGIVE ME
2909-81524-0038 I AM NOT USUALLY SO VERY TALKATIVE IT IS BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS IN QUESTION AND I SHOULD WISH HIS MEMORY TO BE AS DEAR AND AS VENERABLE TO ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD AS IT IS TO ME
2909-81524-0039 WE PASS OVER THE MANY LITTLE DRAMATIC INTRIGUES AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS WITH THE MORE OR LESS ADROIT INTERFERENCES OF THE UNCLE WHICH RAISE AND LOWER ALTERNATELY BERNARD'S HOPES
2909-81524-0040 HE HAS BEAUTIFUL SILVERY HAIR FLYING IN VAGRANT LOCKS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND BEAUTIFUL BISHOP'S HANDS AS HE BECOMES CALM HE HAS AN IMPOSING WAY OF GENTLY RESETTLING HIMSELF IN HIS SACERDOTAL DIGNITY
2909-81524-0041 TO SUM UP HIS IS A PHYSIOGNOMY FULL OF PASSION CONSUMED WITH ZEAL YET STILL FRANK AND SINCERE I WAS HARDLY SEATED
2909-81524-0042 MONSEIGNEUR I SAID I COME TO YOU YOU UNDERSTAND ME AS TO MY LAST RESOURCE WHAT I AM NOW DOING IS ALMOST AN ACT OF DESPAIR
2909-81524-0043 MUST SHOW HIMSELF MORE PITILESS THAN YOURSELF TOWARDS THE FAULTS WITH WHICH I AM REPROACHED I AM AN UNBELIEVER YOU ARE AN APOSTLE AND YET MONSEIGNEUR IT IS OFTEN AT THE HANDS OF SAINTLY PRIESTS SUCH AS YOURSELF
2909-81524-0044 THAT THE GUILTY FIND MOST INDULGENCE AND THEN I AM NOT INDEED GUILTY I HAVE BUT WANDERED I AM REFUSED THE HAND OF YOUR NIECE BECAUSE I DO NOT SHARE HER FAITH YOUR OWN FAITH BUT MONSEIGNEUR
2909-81524-0045 UNBELIEF IS NOT A CRIME IT IS A MISFORTUNE I KNOW PEOPLE OFTEN SAY A MAN DENIES GOD WHEN BY HIS OWN CONDUCT HE HAS BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO A CONDITION IN WHICH HE MAY WELL DESIRE THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST IN THIS WAY HE IS MADE GUILTY
2909-81524-0046 FOR MYSELF MONSEIGNEUR I HAVE CONSULTED MY CONSCIENCE WITH AN ENTIRE SINCERITY AND ALTHOUGH MY YOUTH HAS BEEN AMISS I AM CERTAIN THAT MY ATHEISM PROCEEDS FROM NO SENTIMENT OF PERSONAL INTEREST ON THE CONTRARY
2909-81524-0047 I MAY TELL YOU WITH TRUTH THAT THE DAY ON WHICH I PERCEIVED MY FAITH COME TO NOUGHT THE DAY ON WHICH I LOST HOPE IN GOD I SHED THE BITTEREST TEARS OF MY LIFE IN SPITE OF APPEARANCES I AM NOT SO LIGHT A SPIRIT AS PEOPLE THINK
2909-81524-0048 BELIEVE ME A MAN MAY LOVE SPORT HIS CLUB HIS WORLDLY HABITS AND YET HAVE HIS HOURS OF THOUGHT OF SELF RECOLLECTION DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IN THOSE HOURS ONE DOES NOT FEEL THE FRIGHTFUL DISCOMFORT OF AN EXISTENCE WITH NO MORAL BASIS
2909-81524-0049 WITHOUT PRINCIPLES WITH NO OUTLOOK BEYOND THIS WORLD AND YET WHAT CAN ONE DO YOU WOULD TELL ME FORTHWITH IN THE GOODNESS THE COMPASSION WHICH I READ IN YOUR EYES CONFIDE TO ME YOUR OBJECTIONS TO RELIGION AND I WILL TRY TO SOLVE THEM
2909-81524-0050 AS IF ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND AND THEY LEAVE IN US AS THEY PASS RUINS ONLY AND DARKNESS SUCH HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AND THAT OF MANY OTHERS AND IT HAS BEEN AS INVOLUNTARY AS IT IS IRREPARABLE AND I
2909-81524-0051 MONSIEUR SAID THE BISHOP SUDDENLY CASTING ON ME ONE OF HIS AUGUST LOOKS DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT I AM BUT A PLAY ACTOR IN MY CATHEDRAL CHURCH MONSEIGNEUR YES LISTENING TO YOU ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT WE WERE COME TO A PERIOD OF THE WORLD
2909-81524-0052 PERSONALLY I CLAIM TO BE NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER
2909-81524-0053 NEED I SAY THAT I DID NOT COME HERE TO GIVE YOU OFFENCE DOUBTLESS
2909-81524-0054 YOU KNOW AS WELL AS AND BETTER THAN I THE CONDITION OF THE WORLD AND OF OUR COUNTRY AT THIS TIME YOU KNOW THAT UNHAPPILY I AM NOT AN EXCEPTION THAT MEN OF FAITH ARE RARE IN IT AND PERMIT ME TO TELL YOU MY WHOLE MIND
2909-81524-0055 IF I MUST NEEDS SUFFER THE INCONSOLABLE MISFORTUNE OF RENOUNCING THE HAPPINESS I HAD HOPED FOR ARE YOU QUITE SURE THAT THE MAN TO WHOM ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU WILL GIVE YOUR NIECE MAY NOT BE SOMETHING MORE THAN A SCEPTIC OR EVEN AN ATHEIST
2909-81524-0056 WHAT MONSIEUR A HYPOCRITE MONSEIGNEUR
2909-81524-0057 AS FOR ME
2909-81524-0058 A MAN OF HONOUR
2909-81524-0059 A MAN OF HONOUR YES I BELIEVE IT THEN AFTER AN INTERVAL COME MONSIEUR HE SAID GENTLY YOUR CASE IS NOT AS DESPERATE AS YOU SUPPOSE MY ALIETTE IS ONE OF THOSE YOUNG ENTHUSIASTS THROUGH WHOM HEAVEN SOMETIMES WORKS MIRACLES
2909-81524-0060 AND BERNARD REFUSING ANY ENCOURAGEMENT OF THAT HOPE THE VERY ROOTS OF FAITH ARE DEAD IN HIM FOR EVER
