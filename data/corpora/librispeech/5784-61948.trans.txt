5784-61948-0000 REFLECTED FROM THE VOLCANO IT STRETCHES ITS HUMBLE TENEMENTS ALONG THE END OF A LITTLE FJORD
5784-61948-0001 BASALT IS A BROWN ROCK OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN IT ASSUMES REGULAR FORMS WHICH ASTONISH
5784-61948-0002 AS IF SHE HAD EMPLOYED THE PLUMMET LINE THE COMPASS AND THE RULE
5784-61948-0003 IF ELSEWHERE WE SEE TRUNCATED CONES IMPERFECT PYRAMIDS WITH AN ODD SUCCESSION OF LINES HERE AS IF WISHING TO GIVE A LESSON IN REGULARITY
5784-61948-0004 LAY SCATTERED ON THE GROUND LIKE THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT TEMPLE RUINS ETERNALLY YOUNG
5784-61948-0005 WAS THE LAST STAGE OF OUR JOURNEY
5784-61948-0006 WHEN WE HALTED BEFORE THE HOUSE OF THE RECTOR
5784-61948-0007 KYRKOHERDE CRIED HANS TURNING ROUND AND INTRODUCING HIM TO MY UNCLE
5784-61948-0008 IT APPEARS MY DEAR HARRY THAT THIS WORTHY MAN IS THE RECTOR
5784-61948-0009 I HAD HOWEVER NOTHING TO FEAR
5784-61948-0010 IT WAS NARROW DIRTY
5784-61948-0011 THIS POINT WAS SETTLED BEFORE THEY WOULD AGREE
5784-61948-0012 MY UNCLE PARTLY CONFIDED IN HANS THE EIDER DUCK HUNTER
5784-61948-0013 BUT NOW I WAS ONCE MORE DESTINED TO REALIZE THE ACTUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS
5784-61948-0014 IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT HAMBURG AND NOT AT THE FOOT OF SNEFFELS ONE IDEA ABOVE ALL OTHERS BEGAN TO TROUBLE ME A VERY TERRIBLE IDEA
5784-61948-0015 IF THIS THRICE UNHAPPY
5784-61948-0016 AND UPON THEM I REFLECTED LONG AND DEEPLY I COULD NOT LIE DOWN IN SEARCH OF SLEEP WITHOUT DREAMING OF ERUPTIONS
5784-61948-0017 SO I DETERMINED AT LAST TO SUBMIT THE WHOLE CASE TO MY UNCLE IN THE MOST ADROIT MANNER POSSIBLE
5784-61948-0018 IN FACT I WAS ONLY TOO ANXIOUS NOT TO INTERRUPT HIM AND ALLOWED HIM TO REFLECT AT HIS LEISURE AFTER SOME MOMENTS
5784-61948-0019 FOR NOTHING WOULD BE UNWISER AND MORE INCONSISTENT THAN TO ACT WITH IMPRUDENCE I HEARTILY AGREE WITH YOU MY DEAR UNCLE WAS MY SOMEWHAT HOPEFUL REJOINDER
5784-61948-0020 IT IS NOW SIX HUNDRED YEARS SINCE SNEFFELS HAS SPOKEN BUT THOUGH NOW REDUCED TO A STATE OF UTTER SILENCE
