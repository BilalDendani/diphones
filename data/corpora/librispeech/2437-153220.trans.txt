2437-153220-0000 HE SEEMED CAREFULLY TO SEEK OUT HER TENDER SPOTS SO AS TO TORTURE HER MENTALLY AS HARSHLY AS POSSIBLE PRINCESS MARY HAD TWO PASSIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY TWO JOYS HER NEPHEW LITTLE NICHOLAS AND RELIGION
2437-153220-0001 AND THESE WERE THE FAVORITE SUBJECTS OF THE PRINCE'S ATTACKS AND RIDICULE WHATEVER WAS SPOKEN OF HE WOULD BRING ROUND TO THE SUPERSTITIOUSNESS OF OLD MAIDS OR THE PETTING AND SPOILING OF CHILDREN YOU WANT TO MAKE HIM LITTLE NICHOLAS INTO AN OLD MAID LIKE YOURSELF A PITY
2437-153220-0002 PRINCE ANDREW WANTS A SON AND NOT AN OLD MAID HE WOULD SAY OR TURNING TO MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE HE WOULD ASK HER IN PRINCESS MARY'S PRESENCE HOW SHE LIKED OUR VILLAGE PRIESTS AND ICONS AND WOULD JOKE ABOUT THEM HE CONTINUALLY HURT PRINCESS MARY'S FEELINGS
2437-153220-0003 AND TORMENTED HER BUT IT COST HER NO EFFORT TO FORGIVE HIM COULD HE BE TO BLAME TOWARD HER OR COULD HER FATHER WHOM SHE KNEW LOVED HER IN SPITE OF IT ALL BE UNJUST AND WHAT IS JUSTICE THE PRINCESS NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT PROUD WORD JUSTICE
2437-153220-0004 ALL THE COMPLEX LAWS OF MAN CENTERED FOR HER IN ONE CLEAR AND SIMPLE LAW THE LAW OF LOVE AND SELF SACRIFICE TAUGHT US BY HIM WHO LOVINGLY SUFFERED FOR MANKIND THOUGH HE HIMSELF WAS GOD WHAT HAD SHE TO DO WITH THE JUSTICE OR INJUSTICE OF OTHER PEOPLE
2437-153220-0005 SHE HAD TO ENDURE AND LOVE AND THAT SHE DID DURING THE WINTER PRINCE ANDREW HAD COME TO BALD HILLS AND HAD BEEN GAY GENTLE AND MORE AFFECTIONATE THAN PRINCESS MARY HAD KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME PAST SHE FELT THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
2437-153220-0006 BUT HE SAID NOTHING TO HER ABOUT HIS LOVE BEFORE HE LEFT HE HAD A LONG TALK WITH HIS FATHER ABOUT SOMETHING AND PRINCESS MARY NOTICED THAT BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE
2437-153220-0007 JULIE KARAGINA IN PETERSBURG WHOM SHE HAD DREAMED AS ALL GIRLS DREAM OF MARRYING TO HER BROTHER AND WHO WAS AT THAT TIME IN MOURNING FOR HER OWN BROTHER KILLED IN TURKEY SORROW IT SEEMS IS OUR COMMON LOT MY DEAR TENDER FRIEND JULIE
2437-153220-0008 AS A SPECIAL PROVIDENCE OF GOD WHO LOVING YOU WISHES TO TRY YOU AND YOUR EXCELLENT MOTHER OH MY FRIEND RELIGION AND RELIGION ALONE CAN I WILL NOT SAY COMFORT US BUT SAVE US FROM DESPAIR
2437-153220-0009 RELIGION ALONE CAN EXPLAIN TO US WHAT WITHOUT ITS HELP MAN CANNOT COMPREHEND WHY FOR WHAT CAUSE KIND AND NOBLE BEINGS ABLE TO FIND HAPPINESS IN LIFE NOT MERELY HARMING NO ONE BUT NECESSARY TO THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS
2437-153220-0010 ARE CALLED AWAY TO GOD WHILE CRUEL USELESS HARMFUL PERSONS OR SUCH AS ARE A BURDEN TO THEMSELVES AND TO OTHERS ARE LEFT LIVING THE FIRST DEATH I SAW AND ONE I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT OF MY DEAR SISTER IN LAW LEFT THAT IMPRESSION ON ME
2437-153220-0011 JUST AS YOU ASK DESTINY WHY YOUR SPLENDID BROTHER HAD TO DIE
2437-153220-0012 BUT IN WHOSE SOUL THERE WERE NEVER ANY UNKIND THOUGHTS HAD TO DIE
2437-153220-0013 FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN AND ALREADY I WITH MY PETTY UNDERSTANDING BEGIN TO SEE CLEARLY WHY SHE HAD TO DIE AND IN WHAT WAY THAT DEATH WAS BUT AN EXPRESSION OF THE INFINITE GOODNESS OF THE CREATOR WHOSE EVERY ACTION
2437-153220-0014 THOUGH GENERALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US IS BUT A MANIFESTATION OF HIS INFINITE LOVE FOR HIS CREATURES PERHAPS I OFTEN THINK SHE WAS TOO ANGELICALLY INNOCENT TO HAVE THE STRENGTH TO PERFORM ALL A MOTHER'S DUTIES AS A YOUNG WIFE SHE WAS IRREPROACHABLE
2437-153220-0015 PERHAPS SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO AS A MOTHER AS IT IS NOT ONLY HAS SHE LEFT US AND PARTICULARLY PRINCE ANDREW WITH THE PUREST REGRETS AND MEMORIES BUT PROBABLY SHE WILL THERE RECEIVE A PLACE I DARE NOT HOPE FOR MYSELF
2437-153220-0016 BUT NOT TO SPEAK OF HER ALONE THAT EARLY AND TERRIBLE DEATH HAS HAD THE MOST BENEFICENT INFLUENCE ON ME AND ON MY BROTHER IN SPITE OF ALL OUR GRIEF THEN AT THE MOMENT OF OUR LOSS THESE THOUGHTS COULD NOT OCCUR TO ME I SHOULD THEN HAVE DISMISSED THEM WITH HORROR
2437-153220-0017 BUT NOW THEY ARE VERY CLEAR AND CERTAIN I WRITE ALL THIS TO YOU DEAR FRIEND ONLY TO CONVINCE YOU OF THE GOSPEL TRUTH WHICH HAS BECOME FOR ME A PRINCIPLE OF LIFE NOT A SINGLE HAIR OF OUR HEADS WILL FALL WITHOUT HIS WILL
2437-153220-0018 AND HIS WILL IS GOVERNED ONLY BY INFINITE LOVE FOR US AND SO WHATEVER BEFALLS US IS FOR OUR GOOD YOU ASK WHETHER WE SHALL SPEND NEXT WINTER IN MOSCOW IN SPITE OF MY WISH TO SEE YOU I DO NOT THINK SO AND DO NOT WANT TO DO SO
2437-153220-0019 YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THE REASON FOR THIS IS BUONAPARTE THE CASE IS THIS MY FATHER'S HEALTH IS GROWING NOTICEABLY WORSE HE CANNOT STAND ANY CONTRADICTION AND IS BECOMING IRRITABLE THIS IRRITABILITY IS
2437-153220-0020 AS YOU KNOW CHIEFLY DIRECTED TO POLITICAL QUESTIONS HE CANNOT ENDURE THE NOTION THAT BUONAPARTE IS NEGOTIATING ON EQUAL TERMS WITH ALL THE SOVEREIGNS OF EUROPE AND PARTICULARLY WITH OUR OWN THE GRANDSON OF THE GREAT CATHERINE AS YOU KNOW I AM QUITE INDIFFERENT TO POLITICS
2437-153220-0021 BUT FROM MY FATHER'S REMARKS AND HIS TALKS WITH MICHAEL IVANOVICH I KNOW ALL THAT GOES ON IN THE WORLD AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE HONORS CONFERRED ON BUONAPARTE WHO ONLY AT BALD HILLS IN THE WHOLE WORLD IT SEEMS IS NOT ACCEPTED AS A GREAT MAN
2437-153220-0022 AND MY FATHER CANNOT STAND THIS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF HIS POLITICAL VIEWS THAT MY FATHER IS RELUCTANT TO SPEAK OF GOING TO MOSCOW FOR HE FORESEES THE ENCOUNTERS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM HIS WAY OF EXPRESSING HIS VIEWS REGARDLESS OF ANYBODY
2437-153220-0023 ALL THE BENEFIT HE MIGHT DERIVE FROM A COURSE OF TREATMENT HE WOULD LOSE AS A RESULT OF THE DISPUTES ABOUT BUONAPARTE WHICH WOULD BE INEVITABLE IN ANY CASE IT WILL BE DECIDED VERY SHORTLY OUR FAMILY LIFE GOES ON IN THE OLD WAY EXCEPT FOR MY BROTHER ANDREW'S ABSENCE
2437-153220-0024 HE AS I WROTE YOU BEFORE HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH OF LATE AFTER HIS SORROW HE ONLY THIS YEAR QUITE RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS HE HAS AGAIN BECOME AS I USED TO KNOW HIM WHEN A CHILD KIND AFFECTIONATE WITH THAT HEART OF GOLD TO WHICH I KNOW NO EQUAL HE HAS REALIZED IT SEEMS TO ME
2437-153220-0025 THAT LIFE IS NOT OVER FOR HIM BUT TOGETHER WITH THIS MENTAL CHANGE HE HAS GROWN PHYSICALLY MUCH WEAKER HE HAS BECOME THINNER AND MORE NERVOUS I AM ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM AND GLAD HE IS TAKING THIS TRIP ABROAD WHICH THE DOCTORS RECOMMENDED LONG AGO I HOPE IT WILL CURE HIM
2437-153220-0026 YOU WRITE THAT IN PETERSBURG HE IS SPOKEN OF AS ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE CULTIVATED AND CAPABLE OF THE YOUNG MEN FORGIVE MY VANITY AS A RELATION BUT I NEVER DOUBTED IT THE GOOD HE HAS DONE TO EVERYBODY HERE FROM HIS PEASANTS UP TO THE GENTRY IS INCALCULABLE
2437-153220-0027 ON HIS ARRIVAL IN PETERSBURG HE RECEIVED ONLY HIS DUE I ALWAYS WONDER AT THE WAY RUMORS FLY FROM PETERSBURG TO MOSCOW ESPECIALLY SUCH FALSE ONES AS THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT I MEAN THE REPORT OF MY BROTHER'S BETROTHAL TO THE LITTLE ROSTOVA
