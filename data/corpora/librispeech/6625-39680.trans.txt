6625-39680-0000 THAT THIS MAN WITH A HEART OF BRONZE AND MUSCLES OF STEEL HAD LEFT HOUSE AND FRIENDS EVERYTHING IN SHORT TO GO IN SEARCH OF FORTUNE AND DEATH THE ONE THAT IS TO SAY DEATH HAD CONSTANTLY RETREATED BEFORE HIM AS IF AFRAID OF HIM
6625-39680-0001 NO ONE IS AS BRAVE AS ADVENTUROUS OR AS SKILLFUL AS D'ARTAGNAN WITHOUT AT THE SAME TIME BEING INCLINED TO BE A DREAMER HE HAD PICKED UP HERE AND THERE SOME SCRAPS OF
6625-39680-0002 WORTHY OF BEING TRANSLATED INTO LATIN
6625-39680-0003 AND HE HAD MADE A COLLECTION EN PASSANT
6625-39680-0004 THAT CONTEMPT OF RICHES WHICH OUR GASCON HAD OBSERVED AS AN ARTICLE OF FAITH DURING THE THIRTY FIVE FIRST YEARS OF HIS LIFE HAD FOR A LONG TIME BEEN CONSIDERED BY HIM AS THE FIRST ARTICLE OF THE CODE OF BRAVERY
6625-39680-0005 D'ARTAGNAN WAS NO SOONER POSSESSED OF RICHES THAN HE FELT IT NECESSARY TO ASK HIMSELF IF IN SPITE OF HIS RICHES HE WERE STILL BRAVE TO THIS FOR ANY OTHER BUT D'ARTAGNAN
6625-39680-0006 BUT D'ARTAGNAN WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO ASK HIMSELF SINCERELY AND
6625-39680-0007 IF HE WERE BRAVE THEREFORE TO THIS BUT IT APPEARS TO ME THAT I DREW PROMPTLY ENOUGH AND CUT AND THRUST
6625-39680-0008 TO BE SATISFIED OF MY BRAVERY D'ARTAGNAN HAD HIMSELF REPLIED GENTLY CAPTAIN THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER I WAS BRAVE THAT DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE BURNING MY HOUSE AND THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND EVEN A THOUSAND TO SPEAK AGAINST ONE
6625-39680-0009 THAT IF THOSE GENTLEMEN OF THE RIOTS HAD NOT FORMED THAT UNLUCKY IDEA
6625-39680-0010 NOW WHAT WILL BE BROUGHT AGAINST ME I HAVE NO HOUSE TO BE BURNT IN BRETAGNE
6625-39680-0011 WHICH TO HIM IS WORTH MORE THAN ALL THE HOUSES AND ALL THE TREASURES OF THE WORLD THAT SKIN TO WHICH I CLING ABOVE EVERYTHING
6625-39680-0012 WHICH ENCLOSES A HEART VERY WARM AND READY TO FIGHT AND CONSEQUENTLY TO LIVE THEN I DO DESIRE TO LIVE AND IN REALITY I LIVE MUCH BETTER MORE COMPLETELY SINCE I HAVE BECOME RICH WHO THE DEVIL EVER SAID THAT MONEY SPOILED LIFE UPON MY SOUL IT IS NO SUCH THING
6625-39680-0013 ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMS AS IF I ABSORBED A DOUBLE QUANTITY OF AIR AND SUN MORDIOUX WHAT WILL IT BE THEN IF I DOUBLE THAT FORTUNE AND IF INSTEAD OF THE SWITCH I NOW HOLD IN MY HAND
6625-39680-0014 IN FACT THIS IS NOT A DREAM WHO THE DEVIL WOULD OPPOSE IT IF THE KING MADE ME A MARECHAL
6625-39680-0015 LUCKILY IF THERE IS ANY JUSTICE IN THIS WORLD FORTUNE OWES ME MANY COMPENSATIONS SHE OWES ME CERTAINLY A RECOMPENSE FOR ALL I DID FOR ANNE OF AUSTRIA
6625-39680-0016 FOR IF HE IS RESOLVED TO REIGN HE WILL WANT ME AND IF HE WANTS ME HE WILL GIVE ME WHAT HE HAS PROMISED ME WARMTH AND LIGHT SO THAT I MARCH COMPARATIVELY NOW AS I MARCHED FORMERLY FROM NOTHING TO EVERYTHING
6625-39680-0017 ONLY THE NOTHING OF TO DAY IS THE ALL OF FORMER DAYS
6625-39680-0018 OF THE HEART AS I JUST NOW WAS SPEAKING OF IT BUT IN TRUTH I ONLY SPOKE OF IT FROM MEMORY
6625-39680-0019 SMILING WITH BITTERNESS AH POOR MORTAL SPECIES YOU HOPED FOR AN INSTANT THAT YOU HAD NOT A HEART AND NOW YOU FIND YOU HAVE ONE BAD COURTIER AS THOU ART AND EVEN ONE OF THE MOST SEDITIOUS
6625-39680-0020 A CONSPIRATOR A REAL CONSPIRATOR
6625-39680-0021 THEREFORE WHAT A WEAPON WOULD YOU NOT HAVE AGAINST HIM IF HIS GOOD GRACE AND HIS INTELLIGENCE
6625-39680-0022 NOW THEN LET US SEE KNOWING ALL THAT AND HOLDING MY TONGUE
6625-39680-0023 FOR A DIAMOND WORTH A THOUSAND PISTOLES FOR A SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS AS MUCH BITTERNESS AS KINDNESS I SAVE HIS LIFE
6625-39680-0024 NOW THEN THE KING BECOMES MY SUN
6625-39680-0025 IMPEDIMENTS WHICH WERE ABLE TO RETARD THE PROGRESS OF D'ARTAGNAN THESE REFLECTIONS ONCE MADE HE INCREASED THE SPEED OF HIS HORSE BUT HOWEVER PERFECT HIS HORSE ZEPHYR MIGHT BE IT COULD NOT HOLD OUT AT SUCH A PACE FOREVER
6625-39680-0026 THE DAY AFTER HIS DEPARTURE FROM PARIS HIS MOUNT WAS LEFT AT CHARTRES AT THE HOUSE OF AN OLD FRIEND D'ARTAGNAN HAD MET WITH IN AN
6625-39680-0027 FROM THAT MOMENT THE MUSKETEER TRAVELLED ON POST HORSES THANKS TO THIS MODE OF LOCOMOTION HE TRAVERSED THE SPACE
6625-39680-0028 WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT HE WHO WAS ONLY AT PRESENT A RATHER POOR STAR IN THE HEAVEN OF ROYALTY WOULD ONE DAY MAKE THAT STAR HIS EMBLEM
6625-39680-0029 ONE OF THOSE ANIMALS WHICH AN OFFICER OF THE CAVALRY WOULD NEVER CHOOSE FOR FEAR OF BEING DISGRACED EXCEPTING THE COLOR THIS NEW ACQUISITION RECALLED TO THE MIND OF D'ARTAGNAN THE FAMOUS ORANGE COLORED HORSE WITH WHICH OR RATHER UPON WHICH
6625-39680-0030 HE HAD MADE HIS FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE WORLD TRUTH TO SAY FROM THE MOMENT HE CROSSED THIS NEW STEED IT WAS NO LONGER D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS TRAVELLING IT WAS A GOOD MAN CLOTHED IN AN IRON GRAY JUSTAUCORPS
6625-39680-0031 THAT WHICH BROUGHT HIM NEAREST TO THE CHURCHMAN WAS THAT D'ARTAGNAN HAD PLACED ON HIS HEAD A CALOTTE OF THREADBARE VELVET AND OVER THE CALOTTE A LARGE BLACK HAT NO MORE SWORD A STICK HUNG BY A CORD TO HIS WRIST
6625-39680-0032 BUT TO WHICH HE PROMISED HIMSELF AS AN UNEXPECTED AUXILIARY TO JOIN UPON OCCASION A GOOD DAGGER TEN INCHES LONG
6625-39680-0033 OR RATHER D'ARTAGNAN CALLED IF FURET FERRET
6625-39680-0034 OF MY OWN NAME SO INSTEAD OF D'ARTAGNAN I WILL BE AGNAN SHORT THAT IS A CONCESSION WHICH I NATURALLY OWE TO MY GRAY COAT MY ROUND HAT AND MY RUSTY CALOTTE
6625-39680-0035 MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN TRAVELED THEN PRETTY EASILY UPON FURET WHO AMBLED LIKE A TRUE BUTTER WOMAN'S PAD AND WHO
6625-39680-0036 TWELVE LEAGUES A DAY UPON FOUR SPINDLE SHANKS OF WHICH THE PRACTICED EYE OF D'ARTAGNAN HAD APPRECIATED THE STRENGTH AND SAFETY BENEATH THE THICK MASS OF HAIR WHICH COVERED THEM JOGGING ALONG THE TRAVELER TOOK NOTES STUDIED THE COUNTRY WHICH HE TRAVERSED RESERVED AND SILENT
6625-39680-0037 AND FOR SEEING EVERYTHING WITHOUT AROUSING SUSPICION IN THIS MANNER HE WAS ENABLED TO CONVINCE HIMSELF OF THE IMPORTANCE THE EVENT ASSUMED IN PROPORTION AS HE DREW NEAR TO IT IN THIS REMOTE COUNTRY IN THIS ANCIENT DUCHY OF BRETAGNE WHICH WAS NOT FRANCE AT THAT PERIOD
6625-39680-0038 THE PEOPLE KNEW NOTHING OF THE KING OF FRANCE THEY NOT ONLY DID NOT KNOW HIM BUT WERE UNWILLING TO KNOW HIM ONE FACE A SINGLE ONE FLOATED VISIBLY FOR THEM UPON THE POLITICAL CURRENT THEIR ANCIENT DUKES NO LONGER RULED THEM GOVERNMENT WAS A VOID NOTHING MORE
6625-39680-0039 EVEN IN THE COUNTRY EVEN WITHIN SIGHT OF THAT MYSTERIOUS ISLE LEGENDS AND TRADITIONS CONSECRATE ITS WONDERS EVERY ONE MIGHT NOT PENETRATE IT THE ISLE OF AN EXTENT OF SIX LEAGUES IN LENGTH AND SIX IN BREADTH
6625-39680-0040 WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD FOR A LONG TIME RESPECTED COVERED AS IT WAS WITH THE NAME OF RETZ SO REDOUBTABLE IN THE COUNTRY SHORTLY AFTER THE ERECTION OF THIS SEIGNORY INTO A MARQUISTATE
6625-39680-0041 THE CELEBRITY OF THE ISLE DID NOT DATE FROM YESTERDAY ITS NAME OR RATHER ITS QUALIFICATION IS TRACED BACK TO THE REMOTEST ANTIQUITY
6625-39680-0042 FROM TWO GREEK WORDS SIGNIFYING BEAUTIFUL ISLE THUS AT A DISTANCE OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS IT HAD BORNE IN ANOTHER IDIOM THE SAME NAME IT STILL BEARS
