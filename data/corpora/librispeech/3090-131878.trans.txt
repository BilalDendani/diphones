3090-131878-0000 THE GRASS WAS WET AS VERKAN VALL WHO REMINDED HIMSELF THAT HERE HE WAS CALLED RICHARD LEE CROSSED THE YARD FROM THE FARMHOUSE TO THE RAMSHACKLE BARN IN THE EARLY AUTUMN DARKNESS
3090-131878-0001 IT HAD BEEN RAINING THAT MORNING WHEN THE STRATO ROCKET FROM DHERGABAR HAD LANDED HIM AT THE HAGRABAN SYNTHETICS WORKS ON THE FIRST LEVEL UNAFFECTED BY THE PROBABILITIES OF HUMAN HISTORY THE SAME RAIN HAD BEEN COMING DOWN ON THE OLD KINCHWALTER FARM NEAR RUTTER'S FORT ON THE FOURTH LEVEL
3090-131878-0002 THE WOODS WOULD BE WET MUFFLING HIS QUARRY'S FOOTSTEPS AND CANCELING HIS ONLY ADVANTAGE OVER THE NIGHT PROWLER HE HUNTED HE HAD NO IDEA HOWEVER OF POSTPONING THE HUNT IF ANYTHING THE RAIN HAD MADE IT ALL THE MORE IMPERATIVE THAT THE NIGHTHOUND BE KILLED AT ONCE
3090-131878-0003 AT THIS SEASON A FALLING TEMPERATURE WOULD SPEEDILY FOLLOW THE NIGHTHOUND A CREATURE OF THE HOT VENUS MARSHES WOULD SUFFER FROM THE COLD AND TAUGHT BY YEARS OF DOMESTICATION TO FIND WARMTH AMONG HUMAN HABITATIONS IT WOULD INVADE SOME ISOLATED FARMHOUSE OR WORSE
3090-131878-0004 ONE OF THE LITTLE VALLEY VILLAGES IF IT WERE NOT KILLED TONIGHT THE INCIDENT HE HAD COME TO PREVENT WOULD CERTAINLY OCCUR GOING TO THE BARN HE SPREAD AN OLD HORSE BLANKET ON THE SEAT OF THE JEEP LAID HIS RIFLE ON IT AND THEN BACKED THE JEEP OUTSIDE
3090-131878-0005 THEN HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT REMOVING HIS PIPE AND TOBACCO FROM THE POCKETS AND SPREAD IT ON THE WET GRASS HE UNWRAPPED A PACKAGE AND TOOK OUT A SMALL PLASTIC SPRAY GUN HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM FROM THE FIRST LEVEL
3090-131878-0006 THE SCENT OF THE GIANT POISON ROACH OF VENUS THE ONE CREATURE FOR WHICH THE NIGHTHOUND BORE AN INBORN IMPLACABLE HATRED IT WAS BECAUSE OF THIS COMPULSIVE URGE TO ATTACK AND KILL THE DEADLY POISON ROACH THAT THE FIRST HUMAN SETTLERS ON VENUS LONG MILLENNIA AGO
3090-131878-0007 HAD DOMESTICATED THE UGLY AND SAVAGE NIGHTHOUND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE GAVRAN FAMILY DERIVED THEIR TITLE FROM THEIR VAST VENUS HOTLANDS ESTATES THAT GAVRAN SARN THE MAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THIS THING TO THE FOURTH LEVEL HAD BEEN BORN ON THE INNER PLANET
3090-131878-0008 WHEN VERKAN VALL DONNED THAT COAT HE WOULD BECOME HIS OWN LIVING BAIT FOR THE MURDEROUS FURY OF THE CREATURE HE SOUGHT AT THE MOMENT MASTERING HIS QUEASINESS AND PUTTING ON THE COAT HE OBJECTED LESS TO THAT DANGER THAN TO THE HIDEOUS STENCH OF THE SCENT
3090-131878-0009 TO OBTAIN WHICH A VALUABLE SPECIMEN HAD BEEN SACRIFICED AT THE DHERGABAR MUSEUM OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ZOOLOGY THE EVENING BEFORE CARRYING THE WRAPPER AND THE SPRAY GUN TO AN OUTSIDE FIREPLACE HE SNAPPED HIS LIGHTER TO THEM AND TOSSED THEM IN
3090-131878-0010 THEY WERE HIGHLY INFLAMMABLE BLAZING UP AND VANISHING IN A MOMENT HE TESTED THE ELECTRIC HEADLAMP ON THE FRONT OF HIS CAP CHECKED HIS RIFLE DREW THE HEAVY REVOLVER AN AUTHENTIC PRODUCT OF HIS LINE OF OPERATION AND FLIPPED THE CYLINDER OUT AND IN AGAIN
3090-131878-0011 THEN HE GOT INTO THE JEEP AND DROVE AWAY FOR HALF AN HOUR HE DROVE QUICKLY ALONG THE VALLEY ROADS NOW AND THEN HE PASSED FARMHOUSES AND DOGS PUZZLED AND ANGERED BY THE ALIEN SCENT HIS COAT BORE BARKED FURIOUSLY
3090-131878-0012 AT LENGTH HE TURNED INTO A BACK ROAD AND FROM THIS TO THE BARELY DISCERNIBLE TRACE OF AN OLD LOG ROAD THE RAIN HAD STOPPED AND IN ORDER TO BE READY TO FIRE IN ANY DIRECTION AT ANY TIME HE HAD REMOVED THE TOP OF THE JEEP NOW HE HAD TO CROUCH BELOW THE WINDSHIELD TO AVOID OVERHANGING BRANCHES
3090-131878-0013 HE WAS DRIVING SLOWLY NOW LAYING BEHIND HIM A REEKING TRAIL OF SCENT THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER STOCK KILLING THE NIGHT BEFORE WHILE HE HAD BEEN ON THE FIRST LEVEL THE LOCALITY OF THIS LATEST DEPREDATION HAD CONFIRMED HIS ESTIMATE OF THE BEAST'S PROBABLE MOVEMENTS
3090-131878-0014 HE WAS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS SOMEWHERE NEAR SOONER OR LATER IT WOULD PICK UP THE SCENT FINALLY HE STOPPED SNAPPING OUT HIS LIGHTS HE HAD CHOSEN THIS SPOT CAREFULLY WHILE STUDYING THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MAP THAT AFTERNOON
3090-131878-0015 HE WAS ON THE GRADE OF AN OLD RAILROAD LINE NOW ABANDONED AND ITS TRACK LONG REMOVED WHICH HAD SERVED THE LOGGING OPERATIONS OF FIFTY YEARS AGO ON ONE SIDE THE MOUNTAIN SLANTED SHARPLY UPWARD ON THE OTHER IT FELL AWAY SHARPLY
3090-131878-0016 HE WOULD GET OUT ON THAT SIDE IF THE NIGHTHOUND WERE ABOVE HIM THE JEEP WOULD PROTECT HIM WHEN IT CHARGED HE GOT TO THE GROUND THUMBING OFF THE SAFETY OF HIS RIFLE AND AN INSTANT LATER HE KNEW THAT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE WHICH COULD EASILY COST HIM HIS LIFE
3090-131878-0017 A MISTAKE FROM WHICH NEITHER HIS COMPREHENSIVE LOGIC NOR HIS HYPNOTICALLY ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE OF THE BEAST'S HABITS HAD SAVED HIM AS HE STEPPED TO THE GROUND FACING TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE JEEP HE HEARD A LOW WHINING CRY BEHIND HIM AND A RUSH OF PADDED FEET
3090-131878-0018 HE WHIRLED SNAPPING ON THE HEADLAMP WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND THRUSTING OUT HIS RIFLE PISTOL WISE IN HIS RIGHT
3090-131878-0019 ITS TALON TIPPED FORE PAWS EXTENDED HE FIRED AND THE BULLET WENT WILD THE NEXT INSTANT THE RIFLE WAS KNOCKED FROM HIS HAND INSTINCTIVELY HE FLUNG UP HIS LEFT ARM TO SHIELD HIS EYES
3090-131878-0020 CLAWS RAKED HIS LEFT ARM AND SHOULDER SOMETHING STRUCK HIM HEAVILY ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND HIS CAP LIGHT WENT OUT AS HE DROPPED AND ROLLED UNDER THE JEEP DRAWING IN HIS LEGS AND FUMBLING UNDER HIS COAT FOR THE REVOLVER IN THAT INSTANT HE KNEW WHAT HAD GONE WRONG HIS PLAN HAD BEEN ENTIRELY TOO MUCH OF A SUCCESS
3090-131878-0021 THE NIGHTHOUND HAD WINDED HIM AS HE HAD DRIVEN UP THE OLD RAILROAD GRADE AND HAD FOLLOWED ITS BEST RUNNING SPEED HAD BEEN JUST GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP IT A HUNDRED OR SO FEET BEHIND THE JEEP AND THE MOTOR NOISE HAD COVERED THE PADDING OF ITS FEET
3090-131878-0022 WHILE HE WAS STILL ROLLING UNDER HIS JEEP HIS MIND HAD BEEN BUSY WITH PLANS TO RETRIEVE THE SITUATION SOMETHING TOUCHED THE HEEL OF ONE BOOT AND HE FROZE HIS LEG INTO IMMOBILITY AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO GET THE BIG SMITH AND WESSON FREE
3090-131878-0023 THE SHOULDER HOLSTER HE FOUND WAS BADLY TORN THOUGH MADE OF THE HEAVIEST SKIRTING LEATHER AND THE SPRING WHICH RETAINED THE WEAPON IN PLACE HAD BEEN WRENCHED AND BENT UNTIL HE NEEDED BOTH HANDS TO DRAW THE EIGHT INCH SLASHING CLAW OF THE NIGHTHOUND'S RIGHT INTERMEDIARY LIMB HAD RAKED HIM
3090-131878-0024 THE NIGHTHOUND WAS PROWLING AROUND THE JEEP WHINING FRANTICALLY IT WAS BADLY CONFUSED IT COULD SEE QUITE WELL EVEN IN THE CLOSE DARKNESS OF THE STARLESS NIGHT ITS EYES WERE OF A NATURE CAPABLE OF PERCEIVING INFRARED RADIATIONS AS LIGHT
3090-131878-0025 WAS QUITE HOT HAD HE BEEN STANDING ALONE ESPECIALLY ON THIS RAW CHILLY NIGHT VERKAN VALL'S OWN BODY HEAT WOULD HAVE LIGHTED HIM UP LIKE A JACK O' LANTERN NOW HOWEVER THE HOT ENGINE ABOVE HIM MASKED HIS OWN RADIATIONS
3090-131878-0026 MOREOVER THE POISON ROACH SCENT ON HIS COAT WAS COMING UP THROUGH THE FLOOR BOARD AND MINGLING WITH THE SCENT ON THE SEAT YET THE NIGHTHOUND COULDN'T FIND THE TWO AND A HALF FOOT INSECTLIKE THING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCING IT
3090-131878-0027 VERKAN VALL LAY MOTIONLESS WONDERING HOW LONG THE NEXT MOVE WOULD BE IN COMING THEN HE HEARD A THUD ABOVE HIM
3090-131878-0028 HOPE IT GETS A PAW FULL OF SEAT SPRINGS VERKAN VALL COMMENTED MENTALLY HE HAD ALREADY FOUND A STONE ABOUT THE SIZE OF HIS TWO FISTS AND ANOTHER SLIGHTLY SMALLER
3090-131878-0029 NOW HE SLIPPED HIS REVOLVER INTO HIS WAIST BELT AND WRITHED OUT OF THE COAT SHEDDING THE RUINED SHOULDER HOLSTER AT THE SAME TIME WRIGGLING ON THE FLAT OF HIS BACK HE SQUIRMED BETWEEN THE REAR WHEELS UNTIL HE WAS ABLE TO SIT UP BEHIND THE JEEP
3090-131878-0030 THEN SWINGING THE WEIGHTED COAT HE FLUNG IT FORWARD OVER THE NIGHTHOUND AND THE JEEP ITSELF AT THE SAME TIME DRAWING HIS REVOLVER IMMEDIATELY THE NIGHTHOUND
3090-131878-0031 AT ONCE VERKAN VALL SWARMED INTO THE JEEP AND SNAPPED ON THE LIGHTS HIS STRATAGEM HAD SUCCEEDED BEAUTIFULLY THE STINKING COAT HAD LANDED ON THE TOP OF A SMALL BUSH ABOUT TEN FEET IN FRONT OF THE JEEP AND TEN FEET FROM THE GROUND
3090-131878-0032 THE NIGHTHOUND ERECT ON ITS HAUNCHES WAS REACHING OUT WITH ITS FRONT PAWS TO DRAG IT DOWN AND SLASHING ANGRILY AT IT WITH ITS SINGLE CLAWED INTERMEDIARY LIMBS
3090-131878-0033 THE PARATIMER CENTERED THEM ON THE BASE OF THE CREATURE'S SPINE JUST ABOVE ITS SECONDARY SHOULDERS AND CAREFULLY SQUEEZED THE TRIGGER
3090-131878-0034 RECOCKING THE REVOLVER VERKAN VALL WAITED FOR AN INSTANT THEN NODDED IN SATISFACTION THE BEAST'S SPINE HAD BEEN SMASHED AND ITS HIND QUARTERS AND EVEN ITS INTERMEDIARY FIGHTING LIMBS HAD BEEN PARALYZED
