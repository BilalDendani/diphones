7991-102381-0000 THE SUPREME COURT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE UNITED STATES NEVER HELD ANY MUNICIPAL SOVEREIGNTY JURISDICTION OR RIGHT OF SOIL IN THE TERRITORY OF WHICH ANY OF THE NEW STATES HAVE BEEN FORMED EXCEPT FOR TEMPORARY PURPOSES
7991-102381-0001 THOSE QUESTIONS ON WHICH MEN MIGHT REASON HAD BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF JUDICIAL DECISION
7991-102381-0002 CAME TO BE PRESENTED THE QUESTION WHETHER CUFFEE SHOULD BE KEPT IN HIS NORMAL CONDITION OR NOT THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES COULD DECIDE WHAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE PROPERTY IN A TERRITORY
7991-102381-0003 TO PERFORM HIS PUBLIC DUTY HAVING TAKEN WITH HIM HIS NEGRO SLAVE THE COURT HOWEVER IN GIVING THEIR DECISION IN THIS CASE OR THEIR OPINION
7991-102381-0004 HAVE GONE INTO THE QUESTION WITH SUCH CLEARNESS SUCH PRECISION AND SUCH AMPLITUDE THAT IT WILL RELIEVE ME FROM THE NECESSITY OF ARGUING IT ANY FURTHER THAN TO MAKE A REFERENCE TO SOME SENTENCES CONTAINED IN THAT OPINION
7991-102381-0005 AND HERE LET ME SAY I CAN NOT SEE HOW THOSE WHO AGREED ON A FORMER OCCASION THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF THE SLAVEHOLDER TO TAKE HIS PROPERTY INTO THE TERRITORY
7991-102381-0006 THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF THE CONGRESS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF THE TERRITORY TO LEGISLATE UPON THAT SUBJECT SHOULD BE A JUDICIAL QUESTION
7991-102381-0007 CAN NOW ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE THE OPERATION OF AN OPINION WHICH COVERS THE EXACT POLITICAL QUESTION WHICH IT WAS KNOWN BEFOREHAND THE COURT WOULD BE CALLED UPON TO DECIDE
7991-102381-0008 DECIDED IN STRICTNESS OF TECHNICAL LANGUAGE IT WAS KNOWN IT COULD NOT BE HUNDREDS THOUSANDS A VAST VARIETY OF CASES MAY ARISE AND CENTURIES ELAPSE AND LEAVE THAT COURT
7991-102381-0009 IF OUR UNION STILL EXISTS DECIDING QUESTIONS IN RELATION TO THAT CHARACTER OF PROPERTY IN THE TERRITORIES BUT THE GREAT AND FUNDAMENTAL IDEA WAS THAT AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF ANGRY CONTROVERSY DIVIDING THE PEOPLE AND PARALYZING THE ARM OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
7991-102381-0010 SOME UMPIRE SHOULD BE SOUGHT WHICH WOULD COMPOSE THE DIFFICULTY AND SET IT UPON A FOOTING TO LEAVE US IN FUTURE TO PROCEED IN PEACE AND THAT UMPIRE WAS SELECTED WHICH THE CONSTITUTION HAD PROVIDED TO DECIDE QUESTIONS OF LAW
7991-102381-0011 THE TERRITORY BEING A PART OF THE UNITED STATES THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CITIZEN BOTH ENTER IT UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CONSTITUTION WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS DEFINED AND MARKED OUT
7991-102381-0012 AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN EXERCISE NO POWER OVER HIS PERSON OR PROPERTY BEYOND WHAT THAT INSTRUMENT CONFERS NOR LAWFULLY DENY ANY RIGHT WHICH IT HAS RESERVED
7991-102381-0013 THE POWERS OVER PERSON AND PROPERTY OF WHICH WE SPEAK ARE NOT ONLY NOT GRANTED TO CONGRESS BUT ARE IN EXPRESS TERMS DENIED AND THEY ARE FORBIDDEN TO EXERCISE THEM AND THIS PROHIBITION IS NOT CONFINED TO THE STATES
7991-102381-0014 BUT THE WORDS ARE GENERAL AND EXTEND TO THE WHOLE TERRITORY OVER WHICH THE CONSTITUTION GIVES IT POWER TO LEGISLATE INCLUDING THOSE PORTIONS OF IT REMAINING UNDER TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT
7991-102381-0015 ON THE SAME FOOTING WITH CITIZENS OF THE STATES AND GUARDS THEM AS FIRMLY AND PLAINLY AGAINST ANY INROADS WHICH THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT ATTEMPT UNDER THE PLEA OF IMPLIED OR INCIDENTAL POWERS
7991-102381-0016 AND IF CONGRESS ITSELF CAN NOT DO THIS IF IT IS BEYOND THE POWERS CONFERRED ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT WILL BE ADMITTED WE PRESUME THAT IT COULD NOT AUTHORIZE A TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT TO EXERCISE THEM
7991-102381-0017 IT COULD CONFER NO POWER ON ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED BY ITS AUTHORITY TO VIOLATE THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND IF THE CONSTITUTION RECOGNIZES THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY OF THE MASTER IN THE SLAVE
7991-102381-0018 NO TRIBUNAL ACTING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES WHETHER IT BE LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE OR JUDICIAL HAS A RIGHT TO DRAW SUCH A DISTINCTION
7991-102381-0019 OR DENY TO IT THE BENEFIT OF THE PROVISIONS AND GUARANTEES WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY
7991-102381-0020 THIS IS DONE IN PLAIN WORDS TOO PLAIN TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND NO WORD CAN BE FOUND IN THE CONSTITUTION WHICH GIVES CONGRESS A GREATER POWER OVER SLAVE PROPERTY
7991-102381-0021 OR WHICH ENTITLES PROPERTY OF THAT KIND TO LESS PROTECTION THAN PROPERTY OF ANY OTHER DESCRIPTION THE ONLY POWER CONFERRED IS THE POWER COUPLED WITH THE DUTY OF GUARDING AND PROTECTING THE OWNER IN HIS RIGHTS
7991-102381-0022 UPON THESE CONSIDERATIONS IT IS THE OPINION OF THE COURT THAT THE ACT OF CONGRESS WHICH PROHIBITED A CITIZEN FROM HOLDING AND OWNING PROPERTY OF THIS KIND IN THE TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES NORTH OF THE LINE THEREIN MENTIONED IS NOT WARRANTED BY THE CONSTITUTION
7991-102381-0023 BY BEING CARRIED INTO THIS TERRITORY EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN CARRIED THERE BY THE OWNER
7991-102381-0024 MISTER DAVIS HERE THEN MISTER PRESIDENT I SAY THE UMPIRE SELECTED AS THE REFEREE IN THE CONTROVERSY HAS DECIDED THAT NEITHER THE CONGRESS NOR ITS AGENT THE TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT
7991-102381-0025 HAS THE POWER TO INVADE OR IMPAIR THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A TERRITORY I WILL NOT INQUIRE WHETHER IT BE TECHNICALLY A DECISION OR NOT
7991-102381-0026 IT IS WELL KNOWN TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ME IN THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS THAT FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE QUESTION I HAVE BEEN THE DETERMINED OPPONENT OF WHAT IS CALLED SQUATTER SOVEREIGNTY
7991-102381-0027 I NEVER GAVE IT COUNTENANCE AND I AM NOW LEAST OF ALL DISPOSED TO GIVE IT QUARTER IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT IT MADE ITS APPEARANCE FOR GOOD PURPOSES
7991-102381-0028 AND HIS REFLECTION LED HIM TO A CONCLUSION TO WHICH I DOUBT NOT TO DAY HE ADHERES AS TENACIOUSLY AS EVER BUT FROM WHICH IT WAS MY FORTUNE GOOD OR ILL TO DISSENT WHEN HIS LETTER WAS READ TO ME IN MANUSCRIPT
7991-102381-0029 I BEING TOGETHER WITH SOME OTHER PERSONS ASKED
7991-102381-0030 A FALLACY FRAUGHT WITH MISCHIEF THAT IT ESCAPED AN ISSUE WHICH WAS UPON US WHICH IT WAS OUR DUTY TO MEET
7991-102381-0031 WHICH LED TO A GREATER DANGER I THOUGHT IT A FALLACY WHICH WOULD SURELY BE EXPLODED I DOUBTED THEN AND STILL MORE FOR SOME TIME AFTERWARD WHEN HELD TO A DREAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE POSITION WHICH I OCCUPIED
7991-102381-0032 EACH TO SEND FORTH ITS ARMY KANSAS BECAME THE BATTLE FIELD AND KANSAS THE CRY WHICH WELLNIGH LED TO CIVIL WAR THIS WAS THE FIRST FRUIT MORE DEADLY THAN THE FATAL UPAS
7991-102381-0033 WHAT IS IT I SAY WHICH CAN BE COUNTED IN THE BALANCE ON OUR SIDE AGAINST THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT DUTY WHICH IS IMPOSED UPON US IF ANY ONE BELIEVES CONGRESS HAS NOT THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER
7991-102381-0034 HE ACTS CONSCIENTIOUSLY IN INSISTING UPON CONGRESS NOT USURPING IT IF ANY ONE BELIEVES THAT THE SQUATTERS UPON THE LANDS OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN A TERRITORY ARE INVESTED WITH SOVEREIGNTY
7991-102381-0035 HAVING WON IT BY SOME OF THOSE PROCESSES UNKNOWN TO HISTORY WITHOUT GRANT OR WITHOUT REVOLUTION WITHOUT MONEY AND WITHOUT PRICE HE ADHERING TO THE THEORY
7991-102381-0036 I SAY LAY YOUR HAND UPON THE CONSTITUTION AND FIND THERE THE WARRANT OF YOUR AUTHORITY
7991-102381-0037 WHAT IS THERE TO SUSTAIN YOUR THEORY
7991-102381-0038 AND YOU MUST GOVERN YOUR CONDUCT ACCORDING TO THEM YET I DO NOT DENY YOUR SOVEREIGNTY THAT IS THE POWER TO DO AS THEY PLEASE PROVIDED IT CONFORMS TO THE RULE WHICH OTHERS CHOSE TO LAY DOWN
7991-102381-0039 CAN THIS BE A DEFINITION OF SOVEREIGNTY BUT AGAIN SIR
7991-102381-0040 THAT A TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE CAN DO ANYTHING WHICH A STATE LEGISLATURE CAN DO AND THAT SUBJECT TO THE CONSTITUTION MEANS MERELY THE RESTRAINTS IMPOSED UPON BOTH THIS IS CONFOUNDING THE WHOLE THEORY AND THE HISTORY OF OUR GOVERNMENT
7991-102381-0041 THE STATES WERE THE GRANTORS THEY MADE THE COMPACT THEY GAVE THE FEDERAL AGENT ITS POWERS THEY INHIBITED THEMSELVES FROM DOING CERTAIN THINGS
7991-102381-0042 THEREFORE ITS POWERS ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE POWERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE ONE IS THE CREATURE OF GRANT
7991-102381-0043 AND THE OTHER THE EXPONENT OF SOVEREIGN POWER THE SUPREME COURT HAVE COVERED THE WHOLE GROUND OF THE RELATION OF THE CONGRESS TO THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURES
7991-102381-0044 ARE THOSE PUT UPON THE OTHER IN LANGUAGE SO CLEAR AS TO RENDER IT NEEDLESS FURTHER TO LABOR THE SUBJECT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOLLOWING THE PROMULGATION OF THIS NOTION OF SQUATTER SOVEREIGNTY
7991-102381-0045 WE HAD THE IDEA OF NON INTERVENTION INTRODUCED INTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND IT IS STRANGE TO ME HOW THAT IDEA HAS EXPANDED IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MORE MALLEABLE THAN GOLD
7991-102381-0046 TO HAVE BEEN HAMMERED OUT TO AN EXTENT THAT COVERS BOUNDLESS REGIONS UNDISCOVERED BY THOSE WHO PROCLAIMED THE DOCTRINE NON INTERVENTION THEN MEANT AS THE DEBATES SHOW
7991-102381-0047 TO PROPERTY IN SLAVES WHY SIR THE VERY ACTS WHICH THEY PASSED AT THE TIME REFUTE IT THERE IS THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW AND THAT ABOMINATION OF LAWS WHICH ASSUMED TO CONFISCATE THE PROPERTY OF A CITIZEN
7991-102381-0048 WHO SHOULD ATTEMPT TO BRING IT INTO THIS DISTRICT WITH INTENT TO REMOVE IT TO SELL IT AT SOME OTHER TIME
7991-102381-0049 CONGRESS ACTED THEN UPON THE SUBJECT ACTED BEYOND THE LIMIT OF ITS AUTHORITY AS I BELIEVED CONFIDENTLY BELIEVED AND IF EVER THAT ACT COMES BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT I FEEL SATISFIED THEY WILL DECLARE IT NULL AND VOID
7991-102381-0050 AND REPUDIATE THE LAWS THEY WERE THEN CREATING THE MAN WHO STOOD MOST PROMINENTLY THE ADVOCATE OF THE MEASURES OF THAT YEAR WHO GREAT IN MANY PERIODS OF OUR HISTORY PERHAPS SHONE THEN WITH THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT HIS GENIUS EVER EMITTED
7991-102381-0051 I REFER TO HENRY CLAY HAS GIVEN HIS OWN VIEW ON THIS SUBJECT AND I SUPPOSE HE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY
7991-102381-0052 AND WHICH IN SAID TERRITORIES RESTRICT ABRIDGE OR OBSTRUCT THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF ANY RIGHT OF PERSON OR PROPERTY OF A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES
7991-102381-0053 ARE HEREBY DECLARED AND SHALL BE HELD AS REPEALED UPON THAT MISTER CLAY SAID MISTER PRESIDENT
7991-102381-0054 I THOUGHT THAT UPON THIS SUBJECT THERE HAD BEEN A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING IN THE SENATE THAT THE SENATE WOULD NOT DECIDE ITSELF UPON THE LEX LOCI AS IT RESPECTS SLAVERY
7991-102381-0055 TO BE DECIDED BY THE PROPER AND COMPETENT TRIBUNAL THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES APPENDIX TO CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
7991-102381-0056 THAT WAS THE POSITION TAKEN BY MISTER CLAY THE LEADER A MERE SENTENCE WILL SHOW WITH WHAT VIEW I REGARDED THE DOGMA OF NON INTERVENTION WHEN THAT AMENDMENT WAS OFFERED I SAID BUT WHAT IS NON INTERVENTION SEEMS TO VARY
7991-102381-0057 AS OFTEN AS THE LIGHT AND SHADE OF EVERY FLEETING CLOUD IT HAS DIFFERENT MEANINGS IN EVERY STATE IN EVERY COUNTY IN EVERY TOWN IF NON INTERVENTION MEANS THAT WE SHALL NOT HAVE PROTECTION FOR OUR PROPERTY IN SLAVES
7991-102381-0058 THEN I ALWAYS WAS AND ALWAYS SHALL BE OPPOSED TO IT
7991-102381-0059 THEN I AM OPPOSED TO NON INTERVENTION AND SHALL ALWAYS BE OPPOSED TO IT
7991-102381-0060 MISTER DOWNS ONE OF THE COMMITTEE OF THIRTEEN AND AN ADVOCATE OF THE MEASURES SAID WHAT I UNDERSTAND BY NON INTERVENTION IS AN INTERPOSITION OF CONGRESS PROHIBITING OR ESTABLISHING OR INTERFERING WITH SLAVERY
7991-102381-0061 TO EXCLUDE THE CONGRESS FROM ANY KIND OF LEGISLATION WHATEVER I AM AT A LOSS TO CONCEIVE CERTAIN IT IS IT WAS NOT THE THEORY OF THAT PERIOD AND IT WAS NOT CONTENDED FOR IN ALL THE CONTROVERSIES WE HAD THEN
7991-102381-0062 THAT THE ISSUE WAS BEFORE US AND OUGHT TO BE MET THE SOONER THE BETTER THAT TRUTH WOULD PREVAIL IF PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE BORNE DOWN TO DAY IT WOULD RISE UP TO MORROW AND I STOOD THEN ON THE SAME GENERAL PLEA WHICH I AM MAKING NOW
7991-102381-0063 THE SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS MISTER DOUGLAS AND MYSELF DIFFERED AT THAT TIME AS I PRESUME WE DO NOW WE DIFFERED RADICALLY THEN HE OPPOSED EVERY PROPOSITION WHICH I MADE
7991-102381-0064 WHICH SHOULD BE TAKEN THERE TO REMOVE THE OBSTRUCTIONS OF THE MEXICAN LAWS VOTING FOR A PROPOSITION TO EXCLUDE THE CONCLUSION THAT SLAVERY MIGHT BE TAKEN THERE VOTING FOR THE PROPOSITION EXPRESSLY TO PROHIBIT ITS INTRODUCTION
7991-102381-0065 VOTING FOR THE PROPOSITION TO KEEP IN FORCE THE LAWS OF MEXICO WHICH PROHIBITED IT SOME OF THESE VOTES IT IS BUT JUST TO HIM I SHOULD SAY
7991-102381-0066 WERE OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITS OF ANY INSTRUCTIONS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN BEFORE THE FACT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR ADVANCING IN THIS SAME GENERAL LINE OF THOUGHT THE CONGRESS IN ENACTING TERRITORIAL BILLS LEFT OUT A PROVISION
7991-102381-0067 WHICH HAD BEFORE BEEN USUALLY CONTAINED IN THEM
7991-102381-0068 IT HAS BEEN SOMETIMES ASSUMED THAT THIS WAS THE RECOGNITION OF THE POWER OF THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE TO EXERCISE PLENARY LEGISLATION AS MIGHT THAT OF A STATE IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT WHEN OUR PRESENT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WAS INSTITUTED
7991-102381-0069 THERE WERE THOSE WHO BELIEVED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE THE POWER OF REVISION OVER THE LAWS OF A STATE IT WAS LONG AND ABLY CONTENDED FOR IN THE CONVENTION WHICH FORMED THE CONSTITUTION
7991-102381-0070 AND ONE OF THE COMPROMISES WHICH WAS MADE WAS AN APPELLATE POWER TO LODGE POWER IN THE SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE ALL QUESTIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW BUT DID THIS OMISSION OF THE OBLIGATION TO SEND HERE THE LAWS OF THE TERRITORIES
7991-102381-0071 WORK THIS GRANT OF POWER TO THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY NOT IT COULD NOT AND THAT IT DID NOT IS EVINCED BY THE FACT THAT
7991-102381-0072 AT A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD THE ORGANIC ACT WAS REVISED BECAUSE THE LEGISLATION OF THE TERRITORY OF KANSAS WAS OFFENSIVE TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS COULD NOT ABDICATE ITS AUTHORITY
7991-102381-0073 IT COULD NOT ABANDON ITS TRUST AND WHEN IT OMITTED THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE LAWS SHOULD BE SENT BACK IT CREATED A CASUS WHICH REQUIRED IT TO ACT WITHOUT THE OFFICIAL RECORDS BEING LAID BEFORE IT
7991-102381-0074 AS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE OBLIGATION HAD EXISTED THAT WAS ALL THE DIFFERENCE IT WAS NOT ENFORCING UPON THE AGENT THE OBLIGATION TO SEND THE INFORMATION IT LEFT CONGRESS AS TO ITS POWER
7991-102381-0075 I FIND MYSELF PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO GO AS FULLY INTO THE SUBJECT AS I INTENDED AND THEREFORE OMITTING A REFERENCE TO THOSE ACTS SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT HERE WAS THE RECOGNITION OF THE OBLIGATION OF CONGRESS TO INTERPOSE AGAINST A TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE
7991-102381-0076 FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL RIGHT THAT IS WHAT WE ASK OF CONGRESS NOW I AM NOT DISPOSED TO ASK THIS CONGRESS TO GO INTO SPECULATIVE LEGISLATION I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO WOULD WILLINGLY SEE THIS CONGRESS ENACT A CODE
7991-102381-0077 TO BE APPLIED TO ALL TERRITORIES AND FOR ALL TIME TO COME I ONLY ASK THAT CASES AS THEY ARISE MAY BE MET ACCORDING TO THE EXIGENCY
7991-102381-0078 THEN THE CONGRESS BY EXISTING LAWS AND GOVERNMENTAL MACHINERY SHALL INTERVENE
7991-102381-0079 AS FAR AS MAY BE AN ADEQUATE REMEDY I ASK NO SLAVE CODE NOR HORSE CODE NOR MACHINE CODE I ASK THAT THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND BEFOREHAND
7991-102381-0080 THAT THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT CONCEDE TO THEM THE POWER TO INTERFERE WITH THE RIGHTS OF PERSON OR PROPERTY GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT IT WILL APPLY THE REMEDY
7991-102381-0081 IF THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE SHOULD SO FAR FORGET ITS DUTY SO FAR TRANSCEND ITS POWER AS TO COMMIT THAT VIOLATION OF RIGHT THAT IS THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FIFTH RESOLUTION
7991-102381-0082 THEY HAVE ASSERTED AND VINDICATED HER EQUALITY OF RIGHT BY THAT ASSERTED EQUALITY OF RIGHT I DOUBT NOT SHE WILL STAND FOR WEAL OR FOR WOE FOR PROSPERITY OR ADVERSITY
7991-102381-0083 FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE GREAT BLESSINGS WHICH WE ENJOY OR THE TRIAL OF A NEW AND SEPARATE CONDITION I TRUST MISSISSIPPI NEVER WILL SURRENDER THE SMALLEST ATOM OF THE SOVEREIGNTY INDEPENDENCE AND EQUALITY TO WHICH SHE WAS BORN
7991-102381-0084 TO AVOID ANY DANGER OR ANY SACRIFICE TO WHICH SHE MAY HEREBY BE EXPOSED THE SIXTH RESOLUTION OF THE SERIES DECLARES AT WHAT TIME A STATE MAY FORM A CONSTITUTION AND DECIDE UPON HER DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS
7991-102381-0085 I DENY THIS RIGHT TO THE TERRITORIAL CONDITION BECAUSE THE TERRITORY BELONGS IN COMMON TO THE STATES EVERY CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES AS A JOINT OWNER OF THAT TERRITORY HAS A RIGHT TO GO INTO IT
7991-102381-0086 WITH ANY PROPERTY WHICH HE MAY POSSESS THESE TERRITORIAL INHABITANTS REQUIRE MUNICIPAL LAW POLICE AND GOVERNMENT THEY SHOULD HAVE THEM BUT THEY SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO THEIR OWN NECESSITIES
7991-102381-0087 THEY HAVE NO RIGHT WITHIN THEIR MUNICIPAL POWER TO ATTEMPT TO DECIDE THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXCLUDE ANY CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES FROM OWNING AND EQUALLY ENJOYING THIS COMMON POSSESSION
7991-102381-0088 IT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRESERVING ORDER AND GIVING PROTECTION TO RIGHTS OF PERSON AND PROPERTY THAT A MUNICIPAL TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE INSTITUTED THE LAST RESOLUTION REFERS TO A LAW FOUNDED ON A PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION
7991-102381-0089 WHICH CONTAINS AN OBLIGATION OF FAITH TO EVERY STATE OF THE UNION AND THAT OBLIGATION OF FAITH HAS BEEN VIOLATED BY THIRTEEN STATES OF THE CONFEDERACY AS MANY AS ORIGINALLY FOUGHT THE BATTLES
7991-102381-0090 OF THE REVOLUTION AND ESTABLISHED THE CONFEDERATION IS IT TO BE EXPECTED THAT A COMPACT THUS BROKEN IN PART VIOLATED IN ITS IMPORTANT FEATURES WILL BE REGARDED AS BINDING IN ALL ELSE
7991-102381-0091 IS THE FREE TRADE WHICH THE NORTH SOUGHT IN THE FORMATION OF THE UNION AND FOR WHICH THE STATES GENERALLY AGREED TO GIVE CONGRESS THE POWER TO REGULATE COMMERCE TO BE TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT BY LAWS OF OBSTRUCTION
7991-102381-0092 NOT GIVING TO THE CITIZENS OF THE SOUTH THAT FREE TRANSIT ACROSS THE TERRITORY OF THE NORTHERN STATES WHICH WE MIGHT CLAIM FROM ANY FRIENDLY STATE UNDER CHRISTENDOM AND IS CONGRESS TO STAND POWERLESS BY ON THE DOCTRINE OF NON INTERVENTION
7991-102381-0093 SHALL WE CLAIM NO MORE FROM THAT WHICH WE HAVE CONSTITUTED FOR OUR OWN PURPOSES AND WHICH WE SUPPORT BY DRAINING OUR OWN MEANS FOR ITS SUPPORT WE HAVE HAD AGITATION CHANGING IN ITS FORM AND GATHERING INTENSITY
7991-102381-0094 FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS IT WAS FIRST FOR POLITICAL POWER AND DIRECTED AGAINST NEW STATES NOW IT HAS ASSUMED A SOCIAL FORM IS ALL PREVAILING AND HAS REACHED THE POINT OF REVOLUTION AND CIVIL WAR
7991-102381-0095 FOR IT WAS ONLY LAST FALL THAT AN OVERT ACT WAS COMMITTED BY MEN WHO WERE SUSTAINED BY ARMS AND MONEY RAISED BY EXTENSIVE COMBINATION AMONG THE NON SLAVEHOLDING STATES TO CARRY TREASONABLE WAR AGAINST THE STATE OF VIRGINIA BECAUSE NOW
7991-102381-0096 AS BEFORE THE REVOLUTION AND EVER SINCE SHE HELD THE AFRICAN IN BONDAGE THIS IS PART OF THE HISTORY AND MARKS THE NECESSITY OF THE TIMES
7991-102381-0097 TO SEE WHETHER WE ARE CONFORMING TO OUR PLIGHTED FAITH AND TO ASK SERIOUSLY SOLEMNLY LOOKING EACH OTHER INQUIRINGLY IN THE FACE WHAT WE SHOULD DO TO SAVE OUR COUNTRY THIS AGITATION BEING AT FIRST ONE OF SECTIONAL PRIDE FOR POLITICAL POWER
7991-102381-0098 THERE ARE MEN WHO HABITUALLY SET ASIDE A PORTION OF MONEY WHICH THEY ARE ANNUALLY TO APPLY TO WHAT ARE CALLED CHARITABLE PURPOSES THAT IS TO SAY SO FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT
7991-102381-0099 TO SUPPORT SOME VAGRANT LECTURER WHOSE PURPOSE IS AGITATION AND MISCHIEF WHEREVER HE GOES THIS CONSTITUTES THEREFORE A TRADE A CLASS OF PEOPLE ARE THUS EMPLOYED EMPLOYED FOR MISCHIEF
7991-102381-0100 FOR INCENDIARY PURPOSES PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD BY THOSE WHO FURNISH THE MONEY BUT SUCH IS THE EFFECT SUCH IS THE RESULT OF THEIR ACTION
7991-102381-0101 AND IN THIS STATE OF THE CASE I CALL UPON THE SENATE TO AFFIRM THE GREAT PRINCIPLES ON WHICH OUR INSTITUTIONS REST IN NO SPIRIT OF CRIMINATION HAVE I STATED THE REASONS WHY I PRESENT IT
7991-102381-0102 IF IT MAY BE TO CROWN OUR COUNTRY WITH PEACE AND START IT ONCE MORE IN ITS PRIMAL CHANNEL ON A CAREER OF PROGRESSIVE PROSPERITY AND JUSTICE
7991-102381-0103 THE MAJORITY SECTION CAN NOT BE STRUGGLING FOR ADDITIONAL POWER IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THEIR RIGHTS IF ANY OF THEM EVER BELIEVED IN WHAT IS CALLED SOUTHERN AGGRESSION THEY KNOW
7991-102381-0104 NOW THEY HAVE THE MAJORITY IN THE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICTS AND IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE THEY CAN NOT THEREFORE FEAR AN INVASION OF THEIR RIGHTS THEY NEED NO ADDITIONAL POLITICAL POWER TO PROTECT THEM FROM THAT
7991-102381-0105 THE ARGUMENT THEN OR THE REASON ON WHICH THIS AGITATION COMMENCED HAS PASSED AWAY AND YET WE ARE ASKED IF A PARTY HOSTILE TO OUR INSTITUTIONS SHALL GAIN POSSESSION OF THE GOVERNMENT
7991-102381-0106 THAT WE SHALL STAND QUIETLY BY AND WAIT FOR AN OVERT ACT OVERT ACT IS NOT A DECLARATION OF WAR AN OVERT ACT WHAT WOULD BE THOUGHT OF A COUNTRY THAT
7991-102381-0107 THE POWER OF RESISTANCE CONSISTS IN NO SMALL DEGREE IN MEETING THE EVIL AT THE OUTER GATE I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND I HAVE NO RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR OTHERS WHEN I SAY THAT
7991-102381-0108 IF I BELONGED TO A PARTY ORGANIZED ON THE BASIS OF MAKING WAR ON ANY SECTION OR INTEREST IN THE UNITED STATES IF I KNOW MYSELF I WOULD INSTANTLY QUIT IT WE HAVE MADE NO WAR AGAINST YOU
7991-102381-0109 WE HAVE ASKED NO DISCRIMINATION IN OUR FAVOR WE CLAIM TO HAVE BUT THE CONSTITUTION FAIRLY AND EQUALLY ADMINISTERED TO CONSENT TO LESS THAN THIS WOULD BE TO SINK IN THE SCALE OF MANHOOD WOULD BE TO MAKE OUR POSTERITY SO DEGRADED
7991-102381-0110 WHICH WAS STRONGER THAN TRIPLE BARS OF BRASS AND STEEL THE CEASELESS CURRENT OF KIND OFFICES RENEWING AND RENEWED IN AN ETERNAL FLOW AND GATHERING VOLUME AND VELOCITY AS IT ROLLED
7991-102381-0111 IT WAS A FUNCTION INTENDED NOT FOR THE INJURY OF ANY IT DECLARED ITS PURPOSE TO BE THE BENEFIT OF ALL CONCESSIONS WHICH WERE MADE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT STATES IN THE CONVENTION PROVE THE MOTIVE EACH GAVE TO THE OTHER
7991-102381-0112 YOUNG AS A NATION OUR TRIUMPHS UNDER THIS SYSTEM HAVE HAD NO PARALLEL IN HUMAN HISTORY WE HAVE TAMED A WILDERNESS WE HAVE SPANNED A CONTINENT WE HAVE BUILT UP A GRANARY THAT SECURES THE COMMERCIAL WORLD AGAINST THE FEAR OF FAMINE
7991-102381-0113 HIGHER THAN ALL THIS WE HAVE ACHIEVED A MORAL TRIUMPH WE HAVE RECEIVED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS A CONSTANT TIDE OF IMMIGRANTS
7991-102381-0114 ENERGETIC IF NOT WELL EDUCATED FLEEING SOME FROM WANT SOME FROM OPPRESSION SOME FROM THE PENALTIES OF VIOLATED LAW RECEIVED THEM INTO OUR SOCIETY AND BY THE GENTLE SUASION OF A GOVERNMENT WHICH EXHIBITS NO FORCE
7991-102381-0115 BY REMOVING WANT AND GIVING EMPLOYMENT THEY HAVE SUBSIDED INTO PEACEFUL CITIZENS AND HAVE INCREASED THE WEALTH AND POWER OF OUR COUNTRY IF THEN THIS TEMPLE SO BLESSED
7991-102381-0116 WHICH WE WERE ABOUT TO LOOK TO SEE IT EXTENDED OVER THE CONTINENT GIVING A PROTECTING ARM TO INFANT REPUBLICS THAT NEED IT IF THIS TEMPLE IS TOTTERING ON ITS PILLARS WHAT I ASK CAN BE A HIGHER OR NOBLER DUTY
7991-102381-0117 FOR THE SENATE TO PERFORM THAN TO RUSH TO ITS PILLARS AND UPHOLD THEM
7991-102381-0118 WE HAVE TAMPERED WITH A QUESTION WHICH HAS GROWN
7991-102381-0119 THE PATRIOTISM AND THE SOUND SENSE OF THE PEOPLE WHENEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM ITS HIGH PLACES OF AUTHORITY SHALL PROCLAIM THE TRUTH IN UNEQUIVOCAL LANGUAGE WILL IN MY FIRM BELIEF RECEIVE AND APPROVE IT
7991-102381-0120 BUT SO LONG AS WE DEAL LIKE THE DELPHIC ORACLE IN WORDS OF DOUBLE MEANING SO LONG AS WE ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE FROM RESPONSIBILITY AND EXHIBIT OUR FEAR TO DECLARE THE TRUTH BY THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT ACT UPON IT
7991-102381-0121 WE MUST EXPECT SPECULATIVE THEORY TO OCCUPY THE MIND OF THE PUBLIC AND ERROR TO INCREASE AS TIME ROLLS ON BUT
7991-102381-0122 TO DESTROY OUR GOVERNMENT THE HISTORIAN WHO SHALL ATTEMPT PHILOSOPHICALLY TO EXAMINE THE QUESTION WILL
7991-102381-0123 AND DISCOVERED IT BE COMPELLED TO CRY OUT VERITABLY SO THE UNSEEN INSECT IN THE COURSE OF TIME DESTROYS THE MIGHTY OAK
7991-102381-0124 IF NOT THEN I HOPE THERE IS YET TIME BY THE FULL EXPLICIT DECLARATION OF THE TRUTH TO DISABUSE THE POPULAR MIND
7991-102381-0125 TO AROUSE THE POPULAR HEART TO EXPOSE THE DANGER FROM LURKING TREASON AND ILL CONCEALED HOSTILITY TO RALLY A VIRTUOUS PEOPLE TO THEIR COUNTRY'S RESCUE WHO CIRCLING CLOSER AND DEEPER AS THE STORM GATHERS FURY
7991-102381-0126 AROUND THE ARK OF THEIR FATHERS COVENANT WILL PLACE IT IN SECURITY
