3132-167603-0001 AND HE SAT DOWN ON THE BENCH AT THE GATE AWAITING HIS SERENE HIGHNESS
3132-167603-0002 TO THE NEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF TWO ORDERLIES A COURIER AND A MAJOR DOMO STOOD NEAR BY
3132-167603-0003 A SHORT SWARTHY LIEUTENANT COLONEL OF HUSSARS WITH THICK MUSTACHES AND WHISKERS RODE UP TO THE GATE AND GLANCING AT PRINCE ANDREW INQUIRED WHETHER
3132-167603-0004 HIS SERENE HIGHNESS WAS PUTTING UP THERE AND WHETHER HE WOULD SOON BE BACK PRINCE ANDREW REPLIED THAT HE WAS NOT ON HIS SERENE HIGHNESS STAFF BUT WAS HIMSELF A NEW ARRIVAL
3132-167603-0005 I EXPECT HE'LL BE HERE SOON WHAT DO YOU WANT
3132-167603-0006 BOLKONSKI MADE ROOM FOR HIM ON THE BENCH AND THE LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM YOU'RE ALSO WAITING FOR THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF SAID HE
3132-167603-0007 IT'S AWFUL WITH THOSE SAUSAGE EATERS
3132-167603-0008 WHAT WAS HAPPENING WE KEPT WETWEATING AND WETWEATING DID YOU TAKE PART IN THE CAMPAIGN HE ASKED I HAD THE PLEASURE REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW NOT ONLY OF TAKING PART IN THE RETREAT BUT OF LOSING IN THAT RETREAT ALL I HELD DEAR
3132-167603-0009 I BELONG TO THE PROVINCE OF SMOLENSK
3132-167603-0010 VEWY GLAD TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE I'M LIEUTENANT COLONEL DENISOV BETTER KNOWN AS VASKA SAID DENISOV PRESSING PRINCE ANDREW'S HAND AND LOOKING INTO HIS FACE
3132-167603-0011 WITH A PARTICULARLY KINDLY ATTENTION YES I HEARD SAID HE SYMPATHETICALLY AND AFTER A SHORT PAUSE ADDED YES IT'S SCYTHIAN WARFARE
3132-167603-0012 SO YOU ARE PWINCE ANDWEW BOLKONSKI
3132-167603-0013 SMILING SADLY AND HE AGAIN PRESSED PRINCE ANDREW'S HAND
3132-167603-0014 THIS MEMORY CARRIED HIM SADLY AND SWEETLY BACK TO THOSE PAINFUL FEELINGS OF WHICH HE HAD NOT THOUGHT LATELY BUT WHICH STILL FOUND PLACE IN HIS SOUL
3132-167603-0015 OF LATE HE HAD RECEIVED SO MANY NEW AND VERY SERIOUS IMPRESSIONS SUCH AS THE RETREAT FROM SMOLENSK HIS VISIT TO BALD HILLS AND THE RECENT NEWS OF HIS FATHER'S DEATH
3132-167603-0016 AND HAD EXPERIENCED SO MANY EMOTIONS THAT FOR A LONG TIME PAST THOSE MEMORIES HAD NOT ENTERED HIS MIND AND NOW THAT THEY DID THEY DID NOT ACT ON HIM WITH NEARLY THEIR FORMER STRENGTH
3132-167603-0017 FOR DENISOV TOO THE MEMORIES AWAKENED BY THE NAME OF BOLKONSKI BELONGED TO A DISTANT ROMANTIC PAST
3132-167603-0018 WHEN AFTER SUPPER AND AFTER NATASHA'S SINGING HE HAD PROPOSED TO A LITTLE GIRL OF FIFTEEN WITHOUT REALIZING WHAT HE WAS DOING
3132-167603-0019 HE SMILED AT THE RECOLLECTION OF THAT TIME AND OF HIS LOVE FOR NATASHA AND PASSED AT ONCE TO WHAT NOW INTERESTED HIM PASSIONATELY AND EXCLUSIVELY
3132-167603-0020 THIS WAS A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN HE HAD DEVISED WHILE SERVING AT THE OUTPOSTS DURING THE RETREAT HE HAD PROPOSED THAT PLAN TO BARCLAY DE TOLLY AND NOW WISHED TO PROPOSE IT TO KUTUZOV
3132-167603-0021 THE PLAN WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE FRENCH LINE OF OPERATION WAS TOO EXTENDED
3132-167603-0022 TO BAR THE ADVANCE OF THE FRENCH WE SHOULD ATTACK THEIR LINE OF COMMUNICATION HE BEGAN EXPLAINING HIS PLAN TO PRINCE ANDREW THEY CAN'T HOLD ALL THAT LINE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I WILL UNDERTAKE TO BWEAK THWOUGH
3132-167603-0023 GIVE ME FIVE HUNDWED MEN AND I WILL BWEAK THE LINE THAT'S CERTAIN THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY GUEWILLA WARFARE DENISOV ROSE AND BEGAN GESTICULATING AS HE EXPLAINED HIS PLAN TO BOLKONSKI
3132-167603-0024 IN THE MIDST OF HIS EXPLANATION SHOUTS WERE HEARD FROM THE ARMY GROWING MORE INCOHERENT AND MORE DIFFUSED
3132-167603-0025 HE'S COMING HE'S COMING SHOUTED A COSSACK STANDING AT THE GATE
3132-167603-0026 MOUNTED ON A RATHER SMALL SORREL HORSE A HUGE SUITE OF GENERALS RODE BEHIND HIM BARCLAY WAS RIDING ALMOST BESIDE HIM AND A CROWD OF OFFICERS RAN AFTER AND AROUND THEM SHOUTING HURRAH
3132-167603-0027 HIS ADJUTANTS GALLOPED INTO THE YARD BEFORE HIM
3132-167603-0028 AND HE RAISED HIS HAND TO HIS WHITE HORSE GUARD'S CAP WITH A RED BAND AND NO PEAK NODDING HIS HEAD CONTINUALLY
3132-167603-0029 SUDDENLY HIS FACE ASSUMED A SUBTLE EXPRESSION
3132-167603-0030 AND WITH SUCH FINE FELLOWS TO RETREAT AND RETREAT WELL GOOD BY GENERAL HE ADDED AND RODE INTO THE YARD PAST PRINCE ANDREW AND DENISOV HURRAH HURRAH HURRAH SHOUTED THOSE BEHIND HIM
3132-167603-0031 SINCE PRINCE ANDREW HAD LAST SEEN HIM KUTUZOV HAD GROWN STILL MORE CORPULENT FLACCID AND FAT BUT THE BLEACHED EYEBALL THE SCAR AND THE FAMILIAR WEARINESS OF HIS EXPRESSION WERE STILL THE SAME
3132-167603-0032 HE WAS WEARING THE WHITE HORSE GUARD'S CAP AND A MILITARY OVERCOAT WITH A WHIP HANGING OVER HIS SHOULDER BY A THIN STRAP HE SAT HEAVILY AND SWAYED LIMPLY ON HIS BRISK LITTLE HORSE WHEW
3132-167603-0033 WHEW WHEW HE WHISTLED JUST AUDIBLY AS HE RODE INTO THE YARD HIS FACE EXPRESSED THE RELIEF OF RELAXED STRAIN FELT BY A MAN WHO MEANS TO REST AFTER A CEREMONY
3132-167603-0034 RAISED IT WITH DIFFICULTY ONTO THE SADDLE LEANED ON HIS KNEE GROANED AND SLIPPED DOWN INTO THE ARMS OF THE COSSACKS AND ADJUTANTS WHO STOOD READY TO ASSIST HIM
3132-167603-0035 EVIDENTLY NOT RECOGNIZING HIM MOVED WITH HIS WADDLING GAIT TO THE PORCH WHEW WHEW WHEW
3132-167603-0036 AS OFTEN OCCURS WITH OLD MEN IT WAS ONLY AFTER SOME SECONDS THAT THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY PRINCE ANDREW'S FACE LINKED ITSELF UP WITH KUTUZOV'S REMEMBRANCE OF HIS PERSONALITY AH HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR PRINCE
3132-167603-0037 HE UNBUTTONED HIS COAT AND SAT DOWN ON A BENCH IN THE PORCH
3132-167603-0038 I RECEIVED NEWS OF HIS DEATH YESTERDAY REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW ABRUPTLY KUTUZOV LOOKED AT HIM WITH EYES WIDE OPEN WITH DISMAY AND THEN TOOK OFF HIS CAP AND CROSSED HIMSELF
3132-167603-0039 HE SIGHED DEEPLY HIS WHOLE CHEST HEAVING AND WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE I LOVED HIM AND RESPECTED HIM AND SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU WITH ALL MY HEART HE EMBRACED PRINCE ANDREW
3132-167603-0040 PRESSING HIM TO HIS FAT BREAST AND FOR SOME TIME DID NOT LET HIM GO WHEN HE RELEASED HIM PRINCE ANDREW SAW THAT KUTUZOV'S FLABBY LIPS WERE TREMBLING AND THAT TEARS WERE IN HIS EYES
3132-167603-0041 HE SIGHED AND PRESSED ON THE BENCH WITH BOTH HANDS TO RAISE HIMSELF COME COME WITH ME WE'LL HAVE A TALK SAID HE
3132-167603-0042 BUT AT THAT MOMENT DENISOV NO MORE INTIMIDATED BY HIS SUPERIORS THAN BY THE ENEMY CAME WITH JINGLING SPURS UP THE STEPS OF THE PORCH DESPITE THE ANGRY WHISPERS OF THE ADJUTANTS WHO TRIED TO STOP HIM
3132-167603-0043 LIFTING HIS HANDS WITH A GESTURE OF ANNOYANCE FOLDED THEM ACROSS HIS STOMACH
3132-167603-0044 WELL WHAT IS IT SPEAK DENISOV BLUSHED LIKE A GIRL
3132-167603-0045 AND BOLDLY BEGAN TO
3132-167603-0046 DENISOV CAME FROM THOSE PARTS AND KNEW THE COUNTRY WELL HIS PLAN SEEMED DECIDEDLY A GOOD ONE ESPECIALLY FROM THE STRENGTH OF CONVICTION WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
3132-167603-0047 AND FROM THAT HUT WHILE DENISOV WAS SPEAKING A GENERAL WITH A PORTFOLIO UNDER HIS ARM REALLY DID APPEAR WHAT SAID KUTUZOV IN THE MIDST OF DENISOV'S EXPLANATIONS ARE YOU READY SO SOON
3132-167603-0048 READY YOUR SERENE HIGHNESS REPLIED THE GENERAL
3132-167603-0049 AND AGAIN LISTENED TO DENISOV
3132-167603-0050 AH WE WERE FRIENDS SAID KUTUZOV CHEERFULLY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT FRIEND STAY HERE AT THE STAFF AND TOMORROW WE'LL HAVE A TALK WITH A NOD TO DENISOV HE TURNED AWAY AND PUT OUT HIS
3132-167603-0051 WOULD NOT YOUR SERENE HIGHNESS LIKE TO COME INSIDE SAID THE GENERAL ON DUTY IN A DISCONTENTED VOICE THE PLANS MUST BE EXAMINED AND SEVERAL PAPERS HAVE TO BE SIGNED
3132-167603-0052 AN ADJUTANT CAME OUT AND ANNOUNCED THAT EVERYTHING WAS IN READINESS WITHIN BUT KUTUZOV EVIDENTLY DID NOT WISH TO ENTER THAT ROOM TILL HE WAS DISENGAGED HE MADE A GRIMACE
3132-167603-0053 NO TELL THEM TO BRING A SMALL TABLE OUT HERE MY DEAR BOY I'LL LOOK AT THEM HERE SAID HE
3132-167603-0054 AND LISTENED TO THE GENERAL'S REPORT
3132-167603-0055 ROSY HANDSOME WOMAN IN A PINK DRESS WITH A LILAC SILK KERCHIEF ON HER HEAD HOLDING A DISH AND EVIDENTLY AWAITING THE ENTRANCE OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
3132-167603-0056 IT WAS AND THAT SHE INTENDED TO OFFER HIS SERENE HIGHNESS BREAD AND SALT HER HUSBAND HAS WELCOMED HIS SERENE HIGHNESS WITH THE CROSS AT THE CHURCH AND SHE INTENDS TO WELCOME HIM IN THE HOUSE
3132-167603-0057 SHE'S VERY PRETTY ADDED THE ADJUTANT WITH A SMILE
3132-167603-0058 COULD NOT HELP HEARING BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT NOTHING THE GENERAL COULD SAY WOULD SURPRISE OR EVEN INTEREST HIM THAT HE KNEW ALL THAT WOULD BE SAID BEFOREHAND AND HEARD IT ALL ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD TO
3132-167603-0059 ALL THAT DENISOV HAD SAID WAS CLEVER AND TO THE POINT WHAT THE GENERAL WAS SAYING WAS EVEN MORE CLEVER AND TO THE POINT
3132-167603-0060 SOMETHING INDEPENDENT OF CLEVERNESS AND KNOWLEDGE PRINCE ANDREW WATCHED THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF'S FACE ATTENTIVELY AND THE ONLY EXPRESSION HE COULD SEE THERE WAS ONE OF BOREDOM
3132-167603-0061 CURIOSITY AS TO THE MEANING OF THE FEMININE WHISPERING BEHIND THE DOOR AND A DESIRE TO OBSERVE PROPRIETY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT
3132-167603-0062 BUT DESPISED THEM NOT BECAUSE OF HIS OWN INTELLECT FEELINGS OR KNOWLEDGE HE DID NOT TRY TO DISPLAY ANY OF THESE BUT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING ELSE HE DESPISED THEM BECAUSE OF HIS OLD AGE AND EXPERIENCE OF LIFE
