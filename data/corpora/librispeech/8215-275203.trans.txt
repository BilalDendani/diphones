8215-275203-0000 NOW BOYS SAID CAPTAIN DANIEL DRAW YOUR SKIFF UP BESIDE THE GREYHOUND AND I'LL TELL YOU A STORY OF HOW I WAS ONCE RUN AWAY WITH BY A WHALE WE BOYS DID AS WE WERE BID DRAWING THE SKIFF WELL UP CLEAR OF THE TIDEWAY WE CLAMBERED ON BOARD THE GREYHOUND
8215-275203-0001 WAITED FOR CAPTAIN DANIEL TO BEGIN TAKING A MATCH FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET AND LIGHTING A LONG CLAY PIPE HE SPOKE
8215-275203-0002 ALARSON COFFIN MASTER WE WERE CRUISING ON THE COAST OF BRAZIL WHEN ONE DAY THE LOOKOUT STATIONED AT THE MASTHEAD REPORTED A LARGE SCHOOL OF SPERM WHALES OFF OUR LEE BEAM CAPTAIN COFFIN WHO HAD TAKEN HIS SPY GLASS AND GONE ALOFT AT THE FIRST CRY FROM THE MASTHEAD
8215-275203-0003 ORDERED THE BOATS LOWERED AS THE MEN TUMBLED OVER ONE ANOTHER TO BE FIRST TO REACH THE MONSTERS MY YOUNG HEART DANCED WITHIN ME AND OUR OLD BLACK STEWARD HAD TO HOLD ME BACK I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GO THERE WAS A GENTLE WIND BLOWING
8215-275203-0004 AND THE BOATS CREWS HAVING HOISTED THE SAILS WERE FAST LEAVING THE SHIP CAPTAIN COFFIN NOW ORDERED THE MEN TO GET A SPARE BOAT FROM ITS CRANES OVER THE QUARTER DECK AND FIT IT WITH WHALING IMPLEMENTS THERE WERE ONLY A FEW OF US LEFT ON BOARD FOR SHIP KEEPERS
8215-275203-0005 WE QUICKLY HAD THE BOAT DOWN FROM ITS CRANES AND EVERYTHING READY FOR LAUNCHING
8215-275203-0006 AND CALLING TO THE SHIP'S COOPER HE SAID BANGS YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE SHIP DURING MY ABSENCE FOR EVERY ONE OF OUR BOATS IS FASTENED TO A WHALE
8215-275203-0007 AT LEAST TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THE SHIPS WHICH HAD NOW CROSSED OUR WAKE HE ADDED BLAST THOSE NANTUCKETERS THEY CAN SMELL A SPERM WHALE FIVE MILES TO THEIR LEEWARD ANY TIME HE HAD COME DOWN FROM THE RIGGING AND ORDERED THE HEAD SAILS THROWN BACK
8215-275203-0008 THE ORDER WAS OBEYED AND STEPPING TO THE SHIP'S WAIST HE PLACED HIS POWERFUL SHOULDERS AGAINST THE WHALE BOAT AND SAID NOW BOYS ALL SHOVE TOGETHER AS THE SHIP ROLLED TO THE LEEWARD OUT THROUGH THE GANGWAY SHOT OUR BOAT AND LANDED SAFELY IN THE WATER
8215-275203-0009 I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE THE BOAT LAUNCHED PROPERLY THAT AS SHE STRUCK THE WATER I RAN TO THE OPEN GANGWAY AND NOT NOTICING THE BOAT'S WARP WHICH THE STEWARD HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION TO FASTEN TAUT TO THE SHIP'S RAIL WAS STRUCK BY IT AND THROWN OVERBOARD
8215-275203-0010 YOU MAY LAY TO IT THAT I FLEW DOWN THOSE CABIN STAIRS FOR IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THE WORLD I LONGED FOR IT WAS TO GET A CHANCE TO SEE A SPERM WHALE KILLED AS CAPTAIN COFFIN STEPPED TO THE BOW OF THE BOAT HE ORDERED THE BLACK STEWARD TO HIS PLACE AT THE STEERING OAR
8215-275203-0011 NOTHING BUT WOOD AND BLACK SKIN WILL SUIT ME TO DAY WE SOON CAUGHT UP WITH THE OTHER BOAT THE FIRST AND SECOND OFFICERS HAD EACH KILLED A WHALE
8215-275203-0012 WITH THE NIMROD'S NAME STAMPED UPON IT TO THEIR CARCASSES THE REST OF THE SCHOOL HAD GONE DOWN AND THE THIRD AND FOURTH OFFICERS CREWS WERE RESTING ON THEIR OARS WAITING FOR THE ATTACKED WHALES TO BREAK WATER AGAIN THE OTHER SHIPS NOW HAD THEIR BOATS IN THE WATER
8215-275203-0013 AND AS CAPTAIN COFFIN SAW THEM APPROACH HE CALLED TO HIS OFFICERS DON'T LET THE NANTUCKETERS BEAT US THEY ARE REGULAR SHARKS AFTER SPERM OIL BUT WE HAVE FOUR WHALES THE BEST OF THEM NOW EVERY MAN HERE MUST STRIKE HIS FISH TO DAY
8215-275203-0014 RIGHT BESIDE OUR BOAT AN OLD BULL WHALE SHOWED HIS NOSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SENT A BLAST OF HOT AIR OUT OF HIS SPOUT HOLES WHICH WAS BLOWN BACK TO US BY THE WIND AS WE FELT THE WARM BREATH ON OUR FACES EACH MAN CHECKED HIS OAR AND RIGHT HERE CHILDREN
8215-275203-0015 I WANT TO CORRECT A MISTAKEN IDEA WHALES DON'T SPOUT WATER IT IS THEIR HOT BREATH WHICH LIKE THE BREATH FROM A HORSE'S NOSTRILS IN WINTER SHOWS WHITE AGAINST THE SKY AND LOOKS LIKE WATER
8215-275203-0016 NOW BOYS GIVE WAY TO YOUR OARS AND YOU STEWARD
8215-275203-0017 SPOKE CAPTAIN COFFIN AND AS EACH MAN GAVE A STEADY PULL STEWARD WITH A SKILFUL TURN OF THE STEERING OAR BROUGHT THE HEAD OF THE BOAT ROUND AND THE NEXT INSTANT HER BOW BROUGHT UP AGAINST THE BODY OF THE WHALE
8215-275203-0018 CAPTAIN COFFIN'S WISH WAS FULFILLED FOR IN WHALEMEN'S LORE WE WERE WOOD AND BLACK SKIN INSTANTLY HE PLUNGED HIS HARPOON INTO THE MONSTER'S QUIVERING BLUBBER AND WITH A DEXTERITY THAT WAS
8215-275203-0019 WONDERFUL IN A MAN OF HIS SIZE HE SEIZED ANOTHER AND THRUST IT TO THE HILT BESIDE THE FIRST STERN ALL STERN ALL HE CRIED
8215-275203-0020 AND DRENCHED US TO THE SKIN IT DIVED THEN AND THE WHALE LINE RAN OUT OF ITS TUB SO RAPIDLY THAT THE LOGGERHEAD IN THE STERN AROUND WHICH WAS A TURN OF THE LINE SMOKED LIKE A CHIMNEY POUR SOME WATER ON THAT LINE CRIED THE STEWARD TO THE TUB OARSMAN
8215-275203-0021 AND AS THE MAN OBEYED THE STEWARD TIGHTENED THE TURN ON THE ROPE AND THE BOAT SHOT AHEAD LIKE A RACE HORSE
8215-275203-0022 AND IN A FEW MOMENTS BROKE WATER OFF OUR STARBOARD BOW
8215-275203-0023 WHAT A MOMENT OF AWE IT WAS TO ME AS I LOOKED AT THE MONSTER ANGRILY LASHING THE WATER WITH ITS FINS AND FLUKES THE NEXT INSTANT WE WERE BESIDE THE WHALE AND AS IT ROLLED ON ITS SIDE CAPTAIN COFFIN TRANSFIXED HIM WITH A THRUST OF HIS LANCE THAT SEEMED TO PIERCE HIS VERY VITALS
8215-275203-0024 THE NEXT MOMENT THE BLOOD POURED IN GALLONS FROM HIS SPOUT HOLES HAVING SLACKENED THE LINE FROM THE BOAT WE RESTED ON OUR OARS AT A SAFE DISTANCE AND WATCHED THE MONSTER CIRCLING AROUND IN ITS DYING FURY DURING THIS TIME
8215-275203-0025 THE REST OF THE BOATS HAD EACH SECURED ANOTHER WHALE THE CREW IN THE THIRD OFFICER'S BOAT APPEARED TO BE MAKING SIGNALS OF DISTRESS AND CAPTAIN COFFIN ORDERED US TO CUT LOOSE FROM OUR WHALE AND GO QUICKLY TO THEIR ASSISTANCE
8215-275203-0026 WE SAW AS WE DREW NEAR THEM THAT THE GUNWALE AND THE TWO UPPER STREAKS OF THEIR BOAT HAD BEEN STOVE BY THEIR LAST WHALE AND THE OFFICER WAS ABOUT TO THROW ALL THE WHALING IMPLEMENTS OVERBOARD IN ORDER TO LIGHTEN HER FOR THE CREW WERE DESPERATELY BAILING OUT THE WATER
8215-275203-0027 CAPTAIN COFFIN AT ONCE ORDERED THE MEN TO GET INTO OUR BOAT WITH THEIR IMPLEMENTS
8215-275203-0028 WHICH APPEARED TO BE FAST DYING THE CAPTAIN AFTER SECURING THE END OF THE SEVERED WHALE LINE ATTACHED IT TO THE LINE IN THE THIRD OFFICER'S BOAT AND THEN TOLD ME TO GET INTO THE STOVEN BOAT
8215-275203-0029 AS HE LEFT ME HE SANG OUT DON'T LET THOSE NANTUCKETERS STEAL THE WHALE FROM YOU BOY
8215-275203-0030 TURNING TO THE THIRD OFFICER HE ADDED
8215-275203-0031 AS THE BOATS SEPARATED I TURNED AND WATCHED THE DYING WHALE IT WAS SLOWLY SWIMMING AROUND IN A LARGE CIRCLE AND THE BLOOD WAS JUST OOZING FROM ITS SPOUT HOLES AS IT CAME TO THE SURFACE TO BREATHE THE SUN WAS ABOUT A HANDSPIKE HIGH FROM THE HORIZON
8215-275203-0032 THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE WATER LEFT IN THE BOAT WHICH EMPTY OF MEN NOW FLOATED HIGH
8215-275203-0033 AND TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT THE WHALE THE CREATURE WAS NOT DEAD YET AND THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ANY BLOOD COMING FROM ITS SPOUT HOLES IN FACT IT SEEMED TO BE SPOUTING ALL RIGHT AND WAS NOT CIRCLING AROUND ANY MORE BUT WAS SWIMMING SLOWLY AHEAD WHAT DID IT MEAN
8215-275203-0034 COULD CAPTAIN COFFIN HAVE FASTENED ME TO THE WRONG WHALE I ASKED MYSELF I BEGAN TO FEEL FRIGHTENED FOR ALL OF A SUDDEN THE MONSTER BEGAN TO BEAT THE WATER AGAIN WITH ITS FLUKES AND THE BOAT WAS GOING AT A FASTER RATE OF SPEED
8215-275203-0035 THE SUN HAD NOW REACHED THE WATER'S EDGE AND I COULD NOT SEE ANY BOAT COMING WHAT SHOULD I DO IF THE WHALE TURNED ON ME I LOOKED ROUND FOR A KNIFE TO CUT THE WHALE LINE BUT COULD NOT FIND ONE THE CREW HAD TAKEN ALL THE KNIVES WITH THEM
8215-275203-0036 FAST RUNNING OUT OF ITS TUB FASTER AND FASTER IT RAN UNTIL WITH A JERK THE END FLEW FROM THE TUB AND I THOUGHT I WAS FREE BUT ALAS NO FOR WHEN THE CREW WERE BEING CHANGED ONE OF THEM HAD FASTENED THE SMALL TUB WHICH IS USED FOR A DRAG IN THE END OF THE LINE
8215-275203-0037 AND IT WAS YANKED UNDER THE BOW THWART AND JAMMED THERE THE BOAT NOW SHOT AHEAD WITH FURIOUS SPEED IT WAS GROWING DARKER AND I COULD SCARCELY MAKE OUT THE SHIP IN VAIN I LOOKED FOR THE BOAT WOULD IT NEVER COME TO ADD TO MY TROUBLE
8215-275203-0038 IN FACT THERE WERE WHALES EVERYWHERE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BOAT AND DOWN BENEATH IT I COULD DIMLY SEE THEIR GREENISH WHITE REFLECTIONS AS THEY SWAM JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE ONE OLD COW WHALE AND HER CALF WERE CLOSE BESIDE ME AND AS THEY CAME UP TO SPOUT I COULD FEEL THE WATER
8215-275203-0039 FROM THE SPLASH OF THE LITTLE ONE'S FLUKES
8215-275203-0040 THE BOAT STOPPED WITH A JERK AND UNCOVERING MY FACE I SAW A SIGHT THAT MADE ME SCREAM WITH FRIGHT
8215-275203-0041 WITH A SNAP ITS MOUTH CLOSED AND IT SANK OUT OF SIGHT WHILE I FALLING ON MY KNEES ASKED GOD TO SAVE ME AFTER THAT I FELT BETTER AND MANAGED TO CRAWL UNDER THE STEM SHEETS FOR SHELTER FOR I WAS CHILLED THROUGH IT WAS QUITE DARK ALTHOUGH THE STARS SHONE BRIGHTLY
8215-275203-0042 THE WHALE SEEMED TO HAVE GOT FREE FOR THE BOAT WAS IDLY ROCKING ON THE WATER IN CHANGING MY CRAMPED FORM TO AN UPRIGHT POSITION MY HAND CAME AGAINST A HARD ROUND PIECE OF IRON A FEELING OF SECURITY OF ADVANTAGE OF LONGING FOR BATTLE RAN THROUGH ME AS MY HAND RESTED ON THE COLD STEEL
8215-275203-0043 IT WAS ONE OF THE CAPTAIN'S BOMB GUNS WHICH WAS SO DESPISED BY HIM BUT WHICH MIGHT BE THE MEANS OF SAVING ME FROM AN AWFUL DEATH I PULLED IT FROM ITS SOCKET AND FONDLED IT IN MY EXCITEMENT AND RELIEF AT FINDING SOME MEANS OF DEFENCE
8215-275203-0044 AND ALMOST WISHED THE WHALE WOULD COME BACK I DID NOT FEEL SO LONG FOR THE NEXT INSTANT THE BOAT BEGAN TO MOVE AGAIN I HEARD THE WHALES SPOUTING AND RIGHT ABREAST WAS A MONSTER SWIMMING STRAIGHT TOWARD THE BOAT
8215-275203-0045 THE RECOIL THREW ME AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BOAT WHERE I LAY PARTIALLY STUNNED AND UNABLE TO MOVE I WAS CONSCIOUS ENOUGH HOWEVER TO REMEMBER AND IN SILENT STUPEFIED TERROR I AWAITED A SECOND ONSLAUGHT FROM THE ENRAGED ANIMAL
8215-275203-0046 I SEEMED TO FEEL THE CRUNCHING OF THE BOAT'S TIMBERS IN THOSE AWFUL JAWS AND I MUST HAVE SWOONED IN LOOKING FORWARD TO MY OWN TERRIBLE FATE WHEN I REGAINED MY SENSES ALL WAS QUIET AROUND ME OFF THE SIDE OF THE BOAT AT SOME DISTANCE A WHALE FLOATED ON THE WATER
8215-275203-0047 AFTER WAITING A FEW MOMENTS I VENTURED TO CRAWL FORWARD ON THE THWARTS AND FOUND THE WHALE LINE WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE BOW I WENT BACK TO THE STERN AND SAT ON THE AFTER THWART THINKING OF THE GUN
8215-275203-0048 IT MUST HAVE FALLEN OVERBOARD WHEN I FELL DOWN AS I WAS GROPING I FELT AN OBJECT IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT THAT I KNEW AT ONCE WAS THE BOAT'S LANTERN KEG
8215-275203-0049 IN IT ARE FLINT TINDER A LANTERN CANDLES AND PACKED ALL AROUND THEM ARE SHIP'S BISCUITS INSTANTLY THE MEMORY OF OUR OFFICERS INSTRUCTIONS IN REFERENCE TO THEIR USE CAME TO ME QUICKLY TAKING THE KEG TO THE STERN OF THE BOAT I STRUCK ITS END AGAINST THE LOGGERHEAD
8215-275203-0050 HOW SWEET THE HARD PILOT BREAD TASTED IT BROUGHT TO MY REMEMBRANCE THE WATER KEG WHICH IS ALSO KEPT IN A WHALE BOAT I WENT TO THE MIDSHIP THWART AND FOUND THE KEG THERE LASHED FIRMLY BENEATH IT I LOOSENED IT AND DRANK HEARTILY
8215-275203-0051 I SOON HAD ONE OF THE CANDLES LIGHTED I SAT DOWN ON THE AFTER THWART AND HELD THE LIGHT ALOFT TILL MY ARM ACHED EVERYTHING ABOUT ME WAS MADE MORE WEIRD BY THE GLEAM OF THE LANTERN
8215-275203-0052 THE SWISH OF THE WATER AS IT RIPPLED BENEATH THE BOAT AND THE SCREECHING OF SEA FOWLS THAT HAD NOW GATHERED AROUND THE FLOATING CARCASS SET ME TO THINKING OF THE SHIP
8215-275203-0053 I TRIED TO CALL BUT MY OWN VOICE FRIGHTENED ME IT SOUNDED SO STRANGE SO ONCE MORE I RELAPSED INTO SILENCE SUDDENLY SOMETHING SEEMED TO BE THE MATTER WITH THE WHALE I THOUGHT I HEARD A SOUND LIKE SOME ONE FALLING OVERBOARD WHAT COULD IT BE AT THAT MOMENT
8215-275203-0054 I TIED THE LANTERN TO THE LOGGERHEAD AND CRAWLED UNDER THE STERN SHEETS SO AS NOT TO SEE THEM
8215-275203-0055 SLEEP SOON OVERCAME ME AND TESTING MY HEAD AGAINST THE BOAT'S SIDE I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS
8215-275203-0056 WHILE THE BOAT'S CREW WERE PULLING US TO THE NIMROD THEY HAD SEEN THE LANTERN FROM THE SHIP AND CAPTAIN COFFIN HAD COME HIMSELF IN THE BOAT TO RESCUE ME MY SHOT FROM THE BOMB GUN HAD KILLED THE BULL WHALE
8215-275203-0057 FIRST NOT TO LEAVE A WHALE MERELY BECAUSE IT IS SPOUTING BLOOD FOR IT IS LIABLE AS IN THE PRESENT CASE TO CLEAR ITS SPOUTING AS ITS RUPTURED BLOOD VESSEL IS DRAINED AND LIKE A WOUNDED ANIMAL TO FIGHT WITH RENEWED VIGOR SECOND NOT TO DESPISE THE BOMB GUN
8215-275203-0058 ALWAYS USE YOUR BOMB GUN ON A WHALE CHILDREN WE SOLEMNLY TOLD CAPTAIN DANIEL THAT WE WOULD DO SO
