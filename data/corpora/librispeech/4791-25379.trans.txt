4791-25379-0051 WE ALL THOUGHT SHE WAS DEAD IT WAS SO LONG BEFORE SHE SPOKE OR MOVED OR EVEN OPENED HER EYES HERBERT WAS CRYING TOO NOW AS BITTERLY AS HIS SISTER BUT LUCY DEAR SAID HER MOTHER WIPING HER EYES YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US ANYTHING YET
4791-25379-0052 IF YOU HAD SEEN HIM LOOK AT ARTHUR BUT WHAT DID ARTHUR DO ASKED HERBERT ANXIOUSLY HE PUSHED HER DOWN THAT STEEP HILL THAT YOU REMEMBER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TRY TO CLIMB THE OTHER DAY AT LEAST WE ALL THINK HE DID
4791-25379-0053 BUT SURELY HE DID NOT DO IT INTENTIONALLY SAID MISSUS CARRINGTON FOR WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO HARM SUCH A SWEET GENTLE LITTLE CREATURE AS ELSIE OH MAMMA EXCLAIMED HERBERT
4791-25379-0054 AND HE GREW VERY PALE AND ALMOST GASPED FOR BREATH WHAT IS IT HERBERT DEAR WHAT
4791-25379-0055 FOR HE HAD FALLEN BACK ON HIS PILLOW AND SEEMED ALMOST READY TO FAINT MAMMA HE SAID WITH A SHUDDER MAMMA I BELIEVE I KNOW OH WHY DIDN'T I SPEAK BEFORE AND PERHAPS POOR LITTLE ELSIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAVED ALL THIS
4791-25379-0056 I WILL TELL YOU MAMA AS WELL AS I CAN HE SAID AND THEN YOU MUST TELL ME WHAT I OUGHT TO DO YOU KNOW MAMMA I WENT OUT TO WALK WITH THE REST THE AFTERNOON AFTER THAT PARTY AT MISTER CARLETON'S
4791-25379-0057 FOR IF YOU REMEMBER I HAD STAYED AT HOME THE NIGHT BEFORE AND GONE TO BED VERY EARLY AND SO I FELT PRETTY WELL AND ABLE TO WALK BUT ELSIE WAS NOT WITH US I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE COULD HAVE BEEN SHE ALWAYS THINKS OF MY LAMENESS AND WALKS SLOWLY WHEN I AM ALONG
4791-25379-0058 BUT THIS TIME THEY ALL WALKED SO FAST THAT I SOON GREW VERY TIRED INDEED WITH TRYING TO KEEP UP SO I SAT DOWN ON A LOG TO REST WELL MAMMA I HAD NOT BEEN THERE VERY LONG WHEN I HEARD VOICES NEAR ME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF SOME BUSHES THAT I SUPPOSE MUST HAVE
4791-25379-0059 PREVENTED THEM FROM SEEING ME ONE VOICE WAS ARTHUR'S BUT THE OTHER I DIDN'T KNOW I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LISTENING BUT I WAS TOO TIRED TO MOVE ON SO I WHISTLED A LITTLE TO LET THEM KNOW I WAS THERE THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE THOUGH BUT WENT ON TALKING QUITE LOUD
4791-25379-0060 SO LOUD THAT I COULD NOT HELP HEARING ALMOST EVERY WORD AND SO I SOON LEARNED THAT ARTHUR OWED DICK PERCIVAL A GAMBLING DEBT A DEBT OF HONOR THEY CALLED IT AND HAD SENT THIS OTHER BOY WHOM ARTHUR CALLED BOB TO TRY TO COLLECT IT
4791-25379-0061 HE REMINDED ARTHUR THAT HE HAD PROMISED TO PAY THAT DAY AND SAID DICK MUST HAVE IT TO PAY SOME DEBTS OF HIS OWN ARTHUR ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD PROMISED EXPECTING TO BORROW THE MONEY FROM SOMEBODY I DIDN'T HEAR THE NAME
4791-25379-0062 BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN ELSIE FOR I RECOLLECT HE SAID SHE WOULDN'T LEND HIM ANYTHING WITHOUT TELLING HORACE ALL ABOUT IT AND THAT YOU KNOW IS MISTER DINSMORE'S NAME
4791-25379-0063 HE TALKED VERY ANGRILY SAYING HE KNEW THAT WAS ONLY AN EXCUSE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WISH TO DO HIM A FAVOR AND HE'D PAY HER FOR IT SOME DAY THEN THEY TALKED ABOUT THE DEBT AGAIN
4791-25379-0064 WHEN ARTHUR SAID HE WOULD RECEIVE HIS MONTHLY ALLOWANCE AND SO WOULD CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO PAY IT NOW MAMMA CONCLUDED HERBERT WHAT OUGHT I TO DO DO YOU THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO TELL ARTHUR'S FATHER YES HERBERT I DO
4791-25379-0065 SAID MISSUS CARRINGTON BECAUSE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT HE SHOULD KNOW OF HIS SON'S EVIL COURSES THAT HE MAY PUT A STOP TO THEM AND BESIDES IF ARTHUR SHOULD ESCAPE PUNISHMENT THIS TIME ELSIE MAY BE IN DANGER FROM HIM AGAIN
4791-25379-0066 WHO OVERHEARD THE CONVERSATION BUT IT CANNOT BE HELPED AND WE MUST DO OUR DUTY ALWAYS
4791-25379-0067 HERBERT DREW A DEEP SIGH WELL MAMMA
