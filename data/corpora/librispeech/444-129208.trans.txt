444-129208-0000 CONCLUSION THIS CORRESPONDENCE BY A MEETING BETWEEN SOME OF THE PARTIES AND A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE OTHERS COULD NOT TO THE GREAT DETRIMENT OF THE POST OFFICE REVENUE BE CONTINUED ANY LONGER
444-129208-0001 VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE TO THE STATE COULD BE DERIVED FROM THE EPISTOLARY INTERCOURSE OF MISSUS VERNON AND HER NIECE
444-129208-0002 FOR THE FORMER SOON PERCEIVED BY THE STYLE OF FREDERICA'S LETTERS THAT THEY WERE WRITTEN UNDER HER MOTHER'S INSPECTION AND THEREFORE DEFERRING ALL PARTICULAR ENQUIRY TILL SHE COULD MAKE IT PERSONALLY IN LONDON CEASED WRITING MINUTELY
444-129208-0003 OR OFTEN HAVING LEARNT ENOUGH IN THE MEANWHILE FROM HER OPEN HEARTED BROTHER OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND LADY SUSAN TO SINK THE LATTER LOWER THAN EVER IN HER OPINION
444-129208-0004 SHE WAS PROPORTIONABLY MORE ANXIOUS TO GET FREDERICA REMOVED FROM SUCH A MOTHER AND PLACED UNDER HER OWN CARE AND THOUGH WITH LITTLE HOPE OF SUCCESS WAS RESOLVED TO LEAVE NOTHING UNATTEMPTED THAT MIGHT OFFER
444-129208-0005 A CHANCE OF OBTAINING HER SISTER IN LAW'S CONSENT TO IT HER ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT MADE HER PRESS FOR AN EARLY VISIT TO LONDON AND MISTER VERNON WHO AS IT MUST ALREADY HAVE APPEARED LIVED ONLY TO DO WHATEVER HE WAS DESIRED
444-129208-0006 SOON FOUND SOME ACCOMMODATING BUSINESS TO CALL HIM THITHER WITH A HEART FULL OF THE MATTER MISSUS VERNON WAITED ON LADY SUSAN SHORTLY AFTER HER ARRIVAL IN TOWN AND WAS MET WITH SUCH AN EASY AND CHEERFUL AFFECTION AS
444-129208-0007 MADE HER ALMOST TURN FROM HER WITH HORROR NO REMEMBRANCE OF REGINALD NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT GAVE ONE LOOK OF EMBARRASSMENT
444-129208-0008 AND HER PLEASURE IN THEIR SOCIETY FREDERICA WAS NO MORE ALTERED THAN LADY SUSAN THE SAME RESTRAINED MANNERS THE SAME TIMID LOOK IN THE PRESENCE OF HER MOTHER AS HERETOFORE ASSURED HER AUNT OF HER SITUATION BEING UNCOMFORTABLE
444-129208-0009 AND CONFIRMED HER IN THE PLAN OF ALTERING IT NO UNKINDNESS HOWEVER ON THE PART OF LADY SUSAN APPEARED PERSECUTION ON THE SUBJECT OF SIR JAMES WAS ENTIRELY AT AN END HIS NAME MERELY MENTIONED TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT IN LONDON
444-129208-0010 ACKNOWLEDGING IN TERMS OF GRATEFUL DELIGHT THAT FREDERICA WAS NOW GROWING EVERY DAY MORE AND MORE WHAT A PARENT COULD DESIRE MISSUS VERNON SURPRIZED AND INCREDULOUS KNEW NOT WHAT TO SUSPECT
444-129208-0011 AND WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN HER OWN VIEWS ONLY FEARED GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ACCOMPLISHING THEM THE FIRST HOPE OF ANYTHING BETTER WAS DERIVED FROM LADY SUSAN'S ASKING HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT FREDERICA LOOKED QUITE
444-129208-0012 AS WELL AS SHE HAD DONE AT CHURCHHILL AS SHE MUST CONFESS HERSELF TO HAVE SOMETIMES AN ANXIOUS DOUBT OF LONDON'S PERFECTLY AGREEING WITH HER MISSUS VERNON ENCOURAGING THE DOUBT DIRECTLY PROPOSED HER NIECE'S RETURNING WITH THEM INTO THE COUNTRY
444-129208-0013 LADY SUSAN WAS UNABLE TO EXPRESS HER SENSE OF SUCH KINDNESS YET KNEW NOT FROM A VARIETY OF REASONS HOW TO PART WITH HER DAUGHTER AND AS THOUGH HER OWN PLANS WERE NOT YET WHOLLY FIXED
444-129208-0014 CONCLUDED BY DECLINING ENTIRELY TO PROFIT BY SUCH UNEXAMPLED ATTENTION MISSUS VERNON PERSEVERED HOWEVER IN THE OFFER OF IT AND THOUGH LADY SUSAN CONTINUED TO RESIST HER RESISTANCE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS SEEMED
444-129208-0015 SOMEWHAT LESS FORMIDABLE THE LUCKY ALARM OF AN INFLUENZA DECIDED WHAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN DECIDED QUITE SO SOON LADY SUSAN'S MATERNAL FEARS WERE THEN TOO MUCH AWAKENED FOR HER TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT FREDERICA'S REMOVAL FROM THE RISK OF INFECTION
444-129208-0016 ABOVE ALL DISORDERS IN THE WORLD SHE MOST DREADED THE INFLUENZA FOR HER DAUGHTER'S CONSTITUTION FREDERICA RETURNED TO CHURCHHILL WITH HER UNCLE AND AUNT AND THREE WEEKS AFTERWARDS LADY SUSAN ANNOUNCED HER BEING MARRIED TO SIR JAMES MARTIN
444-129208-0017 THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SPARED HERSELF ALL THE TROUBLE OF URGING A REMOVAL WHICH LADY SUSAN HAD DOUBTLESS RESOLVED ON FROM THE FIRST FREDERICA'S VISIT WAS NOMINALLY FOR SIX WEEKS BUT HER MOTHER THOUGH INVITING HER TO RETURN IN ONE OR TWO AFFECTIONATE LETTERS
444-129208-0018 WAS VERY READY TO OBLIGE THE WHOLE PARTY BY CONSENTING TO A PROLONGATION OF HER STAY AND IN THE COURSE OF TWO MONTHS CEASED TO WRITE OF HER ABSENCE AND IN THE COURSE OF TWO OR MORE TO WRITE TO HER AT ALL
444-129208-0019 FLATTERED AND FINESSED INTO AN AFFECTION FOR HER WHICH ALLOWING LEISURE FOR THE CONQUEST OF HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MOTHER FOR HIS ABJURING ALL FUTURE ATTACHMENTS AND DETESTING THE SEX MIGHT BE REASONABLY LOOKED FOR IN THE COURSE OF A TWELVEMONTH
444-129208-0020 THREE MONTHS MIGHT HAVE DONE IT IN GENERAL BUT REGINALD'S FEELINGS WERE NO LESS LASTING THAN LIVELY WHETHER LADY SUSAN WAS OR WAS NOT HAPPY IN HER SECOND CHOICE I DO NOT SEE HOW IT CAN EVER BE ASCERTAINED
444-129208-0021 FOR WHO WOULD TAKE HER ASSURANCE OF IT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION THE WORLD MUST JUDGE FROM PROBABILITIES SHE HAD NOTHING AGAINST HER BUT HER HUSBAND AND HER CONSCIENCE
444-129208-0022 SIR JAMES MAY SEEM TO HAVE DRAWN A HARDER LOT THAN MERE FOLLY MERITED I LEAVE HIM THEREFORE TO ALL THE PITY THAT ANYBODY CAN GIVE HIM FOR MYSELF I CONFESS THAT I CAN PITY ONLY MISS MAINWARING WHO
444-129208-0023 WAS DEFRAUDED OF HER DUE BY A WOMAN TEN YEARS OLDER
