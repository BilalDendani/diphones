1731-142320-0000 BUT EVER WHEN TRUE FRIENDSHIP BINDS SPIRIT IT IS THAT SPIRIT FINDS IN SPIRIT THEN OUR BLISS WE FOUND IN SPIRIT YET TO THEM I'M BOUND
1731-142320-0001 MARGARET WAS READY LONG BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME AND HAD LEISURE ENOUGH TO CRY A LITTLE QUIETLY WHEN UNOBSERVED AND TO SMILE BRIGHTLY WHEN ANY ONE LOOKED AT HER
1731-142320-0002 AND WHIRLING AWAY PAST THE WELL KNOWN STATIONS SEEING THE OLD SOUTH COUNTRY TOWNS AND HAMLETS SLEEPING IN THE WARM LIGHT OF THE PURE SUN
1731-142320-0003 NONE OF THE BUSTLE AND STIR THAT MARGARET HAD NOTICED IN HER TWO JOURNEYS ON THE LONDON AND NORTH WESTERN LINE LATER ON IN THE YEAR THIS LINE OF RAILWAY SHOULD BE STIRRING AND ALIVE WITH RICH PLEASURE SEEKERS
1731-142320-0004 WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS SO ABSORBED IN THE SIMPLE ACT OF WATCHING THAT IT MADE THE TRAVELLERS WONDER WHAT HE COULD FIND TO DO WHEN THE TRAIN WHIRLED AWAY AND ONLY THE BLANK OF A RAILWAY SOME SHEDS
1731-142320-0005 EVERY MILE WAS REDOLENT OF ASSOCIATIONS WHICH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED FOR THE WORLD BUT EACH OF WHICH MADE HER CRY UPON THE DAYS THAT ARE NO MORE WITH INEFFABLE LONGING THE LAST TIME SHE HAD PASSED ALONG THIS ROAD
1731-142320-0006 WAS WHEN SHE HAD LEFT IT WITH HER FATHER AND MOTHER THE DAY THE SEASON HAD BEEN GLOOMY AND SHE HERSELF HOPELESS BUT THEY WERE THERE WITH HER NOW SHE WAS ALONE AN ORPHAN
1731-142320-0007 AS IT HAD BEEN IN FORMER YEARS NATURE FELT NO CHANGE AND WAS EVER YOUNG MISTER BELL KNEW SOMETHING OF WHAT WOULD BE PASSING THROUGH HER MIND AND WISELY AND KINDLY HELD HIS TONGUE THEY DROVE UP TO THE LENNARD ARMS
1731-142320-0008 HALF FARM HOUSE HALF INN STANDING A LITTLE APART FROM THE ROAD AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT THE HOST DID NOT SO DEPEND ON THE CUSTOM OF TRAVELLERS AS TO HAVE TO COURT IT BY ANY OBTRUSIVENESS
1731-142320-0009 IN SOME HIDDEN RECESSES OF WHOSE LEAFY WEALTH HUNG THE GRIM ESCUTCHEON OF THE LENNARDS THE DOOR OF THE INN STOOD WIDE OPEN BUT THERE WAS NO HOSPITABLE HURRY TO RECEIVE THE TRAVELLERS WHEN THE LANDLADY DID APPEAR
1731-142320-0010 AND THEY MIGHT HAVE ABSTRACTED MANY AN ARTICLE FIRST SHE GAVE THEM A KIND WELCOME ALMOST AS IF THEY HAD BEEN INVITED GUESTS AND APOLOGISED FOR HER COMING HAVING BEEN SO DELAYED
1731-142320-0011 BY SAYING THAT IT WAS HAY TIME AND THE PROVISIONS FOR THE MEN HAD TO BE SENT A FIELD AND SHE HAD BEEN TOO BUSY PACKING UP THE BASKETS TO HEAR THE NOISE OF WHEELS OVER THE ROAD WHICH SINCE THEY HAD LEFT THE HIGHWAY RAN OVER SOFT SHORT TURF WHY
1731-142320-0012 AND THEN SHE WENT UP TO MARGARET AND SHOOK HER HANDS WITH MOTHERLY FONDNESS AND HOW ARE YOU ALL HOW'S THE VICAR AND MISS DIXON THE VICAR ABOVE ALL GOD BLESS HIM WE'VE NEVER CEASED TO BE SORRY THAT HE LEFT
1731-142320-0013 MARGARET TRIED TO SPEAK AND TELL HER OF HER FATHER'S DEATH OF HER MOTHER'S IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MISSUS PURKIS WAS AWARE FROM HER OMISSION OF HER NAME BUT SHE CHOKED IN THE EFFORT AND COULD ONLY TOUCH HER DEEP MOURNING
1731-142320-0014 AND SAY THE ONE WORD PAPA SURELY SIR IT'S NEVER SO SAID MISSUS PURKIS TURNING TO MISTER BELL FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE SAD SUSPICION THAT NOW ENTERED HER MIND THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN HERE IN THE SPRING IT
1731-142320-0015 WHO TOLD US A DEAL OF MISTER HALE AND MISS MARGARET AND HE SAID MISSUS HALE WAS GONE POOR LADY BUT NEVER A WORD OF THE VICAR'S BEING AILING
1731-142320-0016 IT IS SO HOWEVER SAID MISTER BELL HE DIED QUITE SUDDENLY WHEN ON A VISIT TO ME AT OXFORD HE WAS A GOOD MAN MISSUS PURKIS AND THERE'S MANY OF US THAT MIGHT BE THANKFUL TO HAVE AS CALM AN END AS HIS COME MARGARET MY DEAR
1731-142320-0017 HER FATHER WAS MY OLDEST FRIEND AND SHE'S MY GOD DAUGHTER SO I THOUGHT WE WOULD JUST COME DOWN TOGETHER AND SEE THE OLD PLACE AND I KNOW OF OLD YOU CAN GIVE US COMFORTABLE ROOMS AND A CAPITAL DINNER YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME I SEE BUT MY NAME IS BELL
1731-142320-0018 AND ONCE OR TWICE WHEN THE PARSONAGE HAS BEEN FULL I'VE SLEPT HERE AND TASTED YOUR GOOD ALE TO BE SURE I ASK YOUR PARDON BUT YOU SEE I WAS TAKEN UP WITH MISS HALE
1731-142320-0019 AND WASH YOUR FACE IT'S ONLY THIS VERY MORNING I PLUNGED SOME FRESH GATHERED ROSES HEAD DOWNWARD IN THE WATER JUG
1731-142320-0020 WELL TO BE SURE WE MUST ALL DIE ONLY THAT GENTLEMAN SAID HE WAS QUITE PICKING UP AFTER HIS TROUBLE ABOUT MISSUS HALE'S DEATH COME DOWN TO ME MISSUS PURKIS AFTER YOU HAVE ATTENDED TO MISS HALE I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH YOU ABOUT DINNER
1731-142320-0021 THE LITTLE CASEMENT WINDOW IN MARGARET'S BED CHAMBER WAS ALMOST FILLED UP WITH ROSE AND VINE BRANCHES BUT PUSHING THEM ASIDE AND STRETCHING A LITTLE OUT SHE COULD SEE THE TOPS OF THE PARSONAGE CHIMNEYS ABOVE THE TREES
1731-142320-0022 AND THEY BOTH TALK SO MUCH AND BOTH AT A TIME THAT THEY KNOCK ONE DOWN AS IT WERE AND IT'S NOT TILL THEY'RE GONE AND ONE'S A LITTLE AT PEACE THAT ONE CAN THINK THAT THERE WERE THINGS ONE MIGHT HAVE SAID ON ONE'S OWN SIDE OF THE QUESTION
1731-142320-0023 HE'LL BE AFTER THE MEN'S CANS IN THE HAY FIELD AND PEEPING IN AND THEN THERE'LL BE AN ADO BECAUSE IT'S NOT GINGER BEER BUT I CAN'T HELP IT MY MOTHER AND MY GRANDMOTHER BEFORE ME SENT GOOD MALT LIQUOR TO HAYMAKERS AND TOOK SALTS AND SENNA WHEN ANYTHING AILED THEM
1731-142320-0024 AND AFTER THIS RUSTIC LUNCHEON THEY SET OUT TO WALK HARDLY KNOWING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO TURN SO MANY OLD FAMILIAR INDUCEMENTS WERE THERE IN EACH SHALL WE GO PAST THE VICARAGE ASKED MISTER BELL NO NOT YET
1731-142320-0025 WE WILL GO THIS WAY AND MAKE A ROUND SO AS TO COME BACK BY IT REPLIED MARGARET HERE AND THERE OLD TREES HAD BEEN FELLED THE AUTUMN BEFORE OR A SQUATTER'S ROUGHLY BUILT AND DECAYING COTTAGE HAD DISAPPEARED
1731-142320-0026 MARGARET MISSED THEM EACH AND ALL AND GRIEVED OVER THEM LIKE OLD FRIENDS THEY CAME PAST THE SPOT WHERE SHE AND MISTER LENNOX HAD SKETCHED THE WHITE LIGHTNING SCARRED TRUNK OF THE VENERABLE BEECH AMONG WHOSE ROOTS THEY HAD SATE DOWN WAS THERE NO MORE
1731-142320-0027 THE OLD MAN THE INHABITANT OF THE RUINOUS COTTAGE WAS DEAD THE COTTAGE HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN AND A NEW ONE TIDY AND RESPECTABLE HAD BEEN BUILT IN ITS STEAD
1731-142320-0028 AFTERWARDS WE LOSE THE SENSE OF THE MYSTERIOUS I TAKE CHANGES IN ALL I SEE AS A MATTER OF COURSE THE INSTABILITY OF ALL HUMAN THINGS IS FAMILIAR TO ME TO YOU IT IS NEW AND OPPRESSIVE LET US GO ON TO SEE LITTLE SUSAN SAID MARGARET
1731-142320-0029 DRAWING HER COMPANION UP A GRASSY ROAD WAY LEADING UNDER THE SHADOW OF A FOREST GLADE WITH ALL MY HEART THOUGH I HAVE NOT AN IDEA WHO LITTLE SUSAN MAY BE BUT I HAVE A KINDNESS FOR ALL SUSANS FOR SIMPLE SUSAN'S SAKE
1731-142320-0030 QUITE SURE THAT IS IF YOU DON'T WALK SO FAST YOU SEE
1731-142320-0031 YOU WOULD THINK IT ROMANTIC TO BE WALKING WITH A PERSON FAT AND SCANT O BREATH IF I WERE HAMLET PRINCE OF DENMARK HAVE COMPASSION ON MY INFIRMITIES FOR HIS SAKE
1731-142320-0032 I AM CONTENT TO TAKE YOUR LIKING ME WITHOUT EXAMINING TOO CURIOUSLY INTO THE MATERIALS IT IS MADE OF ONLY WE NEED NOT WALK AT A SNAIL'S PACE VERY WELL WALK AT YOUR OWN PACE AND I WILL FOLLOW
1731-142320-0033 BUT SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE GONE OVER THESE DEAR LOVED WALKS IN SILENCE IF INDEED SHE WERE NOT UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO WISH THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALONE THEY REACHED THE COTTAGE WHERE SUSAN'S WIDOWED MOTHER LIVED SUSAN WAS NOT THERE
1731-142320-0034 SHE WAS GONE TO THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOL MARGARET WAS DISAPPOINTED AND THE POOR WOMAN SAW IT AND BEGAN TO MAKE A KIND OF APOLOGY
1731-142320-0035 AND LEARNING TO READ A CHAPTER IN THE NEW TESTAMENT EVERY NIGHT BY HER SIDE THAN FROM ALL THE SCHOOLING UNDER THE SUN MARGARET DID NOT WANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO GO ON BY REPLYING TO HIM AND SO PROLONGING THE DISCUSSION BEFORE THE MOTHER
1731-142320-0036 SO SHE TURNED TO HER AND ASKED HOW IS OLD BETTY BARNES I DON'T KNOW SAID THE WOMAN RATHER SHORTLY WE'SE NOT FRIENDS WHY NOT ASKED MARGARET WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN THE PEACEMAKER OF THE VILLAGE SHE STOLE MY CAT
1731-142320-0037 I DON'T KNOW I RECKON
1731-142320-0038 IT WAS NO EXPLANATION BY DINT OF QUESTIONING MARGARET EXTRACTED FROM HER THE HORRIBLE FACT THAT BETTY BARNES HAVING BEEN INDUCED BY A GYPSY FORTUNE TELLER TO LEND THE LATTER HER HUSBAND'S SUNDAY CLOTHES
1731-142320-0039 BECAME ALARMED BY THEIR NON APPEARANCE AND HER CONSEQUENT DREAD OF HER HUSBAND'S ANGER AND AS ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE SAVAGE COUNTRY SUPERSTITIONS THE CRIES OF A CAT IN THE AGONIES OF BEING BOILED OR ROASTED ALIVE COMPELLED AS IT WERE
1731-142320-0040 BUT AT THE END THE BEWILDERED WOMAN SIMPLY REPEATED HER FIRST ASSERTION NAMELY THAT IT WERE VERY CRUEL FOR SURE AND SHE SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO IT
1731-142320-0041 SHE HAD HEARD IT ALL HER LIFE BUT IT WERE VERY CRUEL FOR ALL THAT MARGARET GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND WALKED AWAY SICK AT HEART YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL NOT TO TRIUMPH OVER ME SAID MISTER BELL
1731-142320-0042 HOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN I OWN I AM WRONG ABOUT SCHOOLING ANYTHING RATHER THAN HAVE THAT CHILD BROUGHT UP IN SUCH PRACTICAL PAGANISM OH I REMEMBER POOR LITTLE SUSAN I MUST GO AND SEE HER WOULD YOU MIND CALLING AT THE SCHOOL
1731-142320-0043 THE BUZZ OF VOICES LIKE THE MURMUR OF A HIVE OF BUSY HUMAN BEES MADE ITSELF HEARD AS SOON AS THEY EMERGED FROM THE FOREST ON THE MORE OPEN VILLAGE GREEN ON WHICH THE SCHOOL WAS SITUATED
1731-142320-0044 BUT IN AN INSTANT SHE HAD CONQUERED THIS FEELING AND MODESTLY ADVANCED MEETING MANY A BRIGHT GLANCE OF RECOGNITION AND HEARING MANY A HALF SUPPRESSED MURMUR OF IT'S MISS HALE THE VICAR'S LADY HEARD THE NAME AND HER MANNER AT ONCE BECAME MORE KINDLY
1731-142320-0045 THE LADY HELD OUT A HAND TO MISTER BELL WITH
1731-142320-0046 MARGARET EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS NOT HER FATHER AND STAMMERED OUT THE FACT OF HIS DEATH WONDERING ALL THE TIME HOW MISTER HALE COULD HAVE BORNE COMING TO REVISIT HELSTONE IF IT HAD BEEN AS THE VICAR'S LADY SUPPOSED
1731-142320-0047 FIRST CLASS STAND UP FOR A PARSING LESSON WITH MISS HALE POOR MARGARET WHOSE VISIT WAS SENTIMENTAL NOT IN ANY DEGREE INSPECTIVE FELT HERSELF TAKEN IN BUT AS IN SOME WAY BRINGING HER IN CONTACT WITH LITTLE EAGER FACES ONCE WELL KNOWN
1731-142320-0048 AND WHO HAD RECEIVED THE SOLEMN RITE OF BAPTISM FROM HER FATHER SHE SATE DOWN HALF LOSING HERSELF IN TRACING OUT THE CHANGING FEATURES OF THE GIRLS AND HOLDING SUSAN'S HAND FOR A MINUTE OR TWO UNOBSERVED BY ALL
1731-142320-0049 WHILE THE FIRST CLASS SOUGHT FOR THEIR BOOKS AND THE VICAR'S LADY WENT AS NEAR AS A LADY COULD TOWARDS HOLDING MISTER BELL BY THE BUTTON WHILE SHE EXPLAINED THE PHONETIC SYSTEM TO HIM AND GAVE HIM A CONVERSATION SHE HAD HAD WITH THE INSPECTOR ABOUT IT
1731-142320-0050 BUT WE ARE TAUGHT BY MISTER MILSOME TO CALL A AN WHO CAN REMEMBER AN ADJECTIVE ABSOLUTE SAID HALF A DOZEN VOICES AT ONCE
1731-142320-0051 THE CHILDREN KNEW MORE THAN SHE DID MISTER BELL TURNED AWAY AND SMILED MARGARET SPOKE NO MORE DURING THE LESSON BUT AFTER IT WAS OVER SHE WENT QUIETLY ROUND TO ONE OR TWO OLD FAVOURITES
1731-142320-0052 THOUGH A TINGE OF SADNESS MIXED ITSELF WITH HER PLEASURE WHEN SCHOOL WAS OVER FOR THE DAY IT WAS YET EARLY IN THE SUMMER AFTERNOON
1731-142320-0053 AND SEE THE THE WORD IMPROVEMENTS HAD HALF SLIPPED OUT OF HER MOUTH BUT SHE SUBSTITUTED THE MORE CAUTIOUS TERM ALTERATIONS WHICH THE PRESENT VICAR WAS MAKING
1731-142320-0054 THE PARSONAGE WAS SO ALTERED BOTH INSIDE AND OUT THAT THE REAL PAIN WAS LESS THAN SHE HAD ANTICIPATED IT WAS NOT LIKE THE SAME PLACE THE GARDEN THE GRASS PLAT
1731-142320-0055 FORMERLY SO DAINTILY TRIM THAT EVEN A STRAY ROSE LEAF SEEMED LIKE A FLECK ON ITS EXQUISITE ARRANGEMENT AND PROPRIETY WAS STREWED WITH CHILDREN'S THINGS A BAG OF MARBLES HERE A HOOP THERE
1731-142320-0056 TO THE DESTRUCTION OF A LONG BEAUTIFUL TENDER BRANCH LADEN WITH FLOWERS WHICH IN FORMER DAYS WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAINED UP TENDERLY AS IF BELOVED THE LITTLE SQUARE MATTED HALL WAS EQUALLY FILLED WITH SIGNS OF MERRY HEALTHY ROUGH CHILDHOOD AH SAID MISSUS HEPWORTH
1731-142320-0057 WHO STRAGGLED TO THE TEMPTING BEER HOUSE UNOBSERVED AS THEY MIGHT HOPE BUT NOT UNOBSERVED IN REALITY FOR THE ACTIVE VICAR KEPT HIS EYE ON THE ROAD EVEN DURING THE COMPOSITION OF HIS MOST ORTHODOX SERMONS
1731-142320-0058 THEY WERE BOTH OF THEM TIRED AND MARGARET HERSELF SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WAS UNWILLING TO GO OUT AS SHE HAD PROPOSED TO DO AND HAVE ANOTHER RAMBLE AMONG THE WOODS AND FIELDS SO CLOSE TO THE HOME OF HER CHILDHOOD
1731-142320-0059 AND SOMEHOW THIS VISIT TO HELSTONE HAD NOT BEEN ALL HAD NOT BEEN EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED THERE WAS CHANGE EVERYWHERE SLIGHT YET PERVADING ALL
1731-142320-0060 HOUSEHOLDS WERE CHANGED BY ABSENCE OR DEATH OR MARRIAGE OR THE NATURAL MUTATIONS BROUGHT BY DAYS AND MONTHS AND YEARS WHICH CARRY US ON IMPERCEPTIBLY FROM CHILDHOOD TO YOUTH
1731-142320-0061 WHENCE WE DROP LIKE FRUIT FULLY RIPE INTO THE QUIET MOTHER EARTH PLACES WERE CHANGED A TREE GONE HERE
1731-142320-0062 WHICH HARMONISED WELL WITH HER PENSIVE THOUGHT MISTER BELL SLEPT SOUNDLY AFTER HIS UNUSUAL EXERCISE THROUGH THE DAY AT LAST HE WAS ROUSED BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE TEA TRAY BROUGHT IN BY A FLUSHED LOOKING COUNTRY GIRL
1731-142320-0063 WHO HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN FINDING SOME VARIETY FROM HER USUAL OCCUPATION OF WAITER IN ASSISTING THIS DAY IN THE HAYFIELD
1731-142320-0064 SUDDENLY LOOKING UP AT HIM WITH HER CLEAR HONEST EYES I TOLD A LIE AND HER FACE BECAME SCARLET TRUE THAT WAS BAD I OWN
1731-142320-0065 NOT BUT WHAT I HAVE TOLD A PRETTY ROUND NUMBER IN MY LIFE NOT ALL IN DOWNRIGHT WORDS AS I SUPPOSE YOU DID BUT IN ACTIONS OR IN SOME SHABBY CIRCUMLOCUTORY WAY LEADING PEOPLE EITHER TO DISBELIEVE THE TRUTH
1731-142320-0066 THE TAINTING BLOOD OF FALSEHOOD RUNS THROUGH US ALL I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED YOU AS FAR FROM IT AS MOST PEOPLE WHAT CRYING CHILD NAY NOW WE'LL NOT TALK OF IT IF IT ENDS IN THIS WAY I DARE SAY YOU HAVE BEEN SORRY FOR IT AND THAT YOU WON'T DO IT AGAIN
1731-142320-0067 AND IT'S LONG AGO NOW AND IN SHORT I WANT YOU TO BE VERY CHEERFUL AND NOT VERY SAD THIS EVENING MARGARET WIPED HER EYES AND TRIED TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE BUT SUDDENLY SHE BURST OUT AFRESH PLEASE MISTER BELL LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT IT
1731-142320-0068 YOU COULD PERHAPS HELP ME A LITTLE NO NOT HELP ME BUT IF YOU KNEW THE TRUTH PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ME TO RIGHTS THAT IS NOT IT AFTER ALL SAID SHE IN DESPAIR AT NOT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS HERSELF MORE EXACTLY AS SHE WISHED
1731-142320-0069 AND I WAS UNDONE WITH ANXIETY AND AFRAID TOO THAT I MIGHT HAVE DRAWN HIM INTO DANGER AND WE HAD AN ALARM JUST AFTER HER DEATH FOR DIXON MET SOME ONE IN MILTON A MAN CALLED LEONARDS WHO HAD KNOWN FRED AND WHO SEEMED TO OWE HIM A GRUDGE
1731-142320-0070 AND WITH THIS NEW FRIGHT I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER HURRY OFF FRED TO LONDON WHERE AS YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT WE SAID THE OTHER NIGHT HE WAS TO GO TO CONSULT MISTER LENNOX AS TO HIS CHANCES IF HE STOOD THE TRIAL SO WE THAT IS HE AND I
1731-142320-0071 AND WE WERE TOO EARLY AND WENT OUT TO WALK IN A FIELD JUST CLOSE BY I WAS ALWAYS IN A PANIC ABOUT THIS LEONARDS WHO WAS I KNEW SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
1731-142320-0072 SOME ONE CAME BY ON HORSEBACK IN THE ROAD JUST BELOW THE FIELD STYLE BY WHICH WE STOOD I SAW HIM LOOK AT ME BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHO IT WAS AT FIRST THE SUN WAS SO IN MY EYES BUT IN AN INSTANT THE DAZZLE WENT OFF AND I SAW IT WAS MISTER THORNTON AND WE BOWED
1731-142320-0073 AND HE SAW FREDERICK OF COURSE SAID MISTER BELL HELPING HER ON WITH HER STORY AS HE THOUGHT YES AND THEN AT THE STATION A MAN CAME UP TIPSY AND REELING AND HE TRIED TO COLLAR FRED AND OVER BALANCED HIMSELF AS FRED WRENCHED HIMSELF AWAY
1731-142320-0074 AND FELL OVER THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM NOT FAR NOT DEEP NOT ABOVE THREE FEET BUT OH MISTER BELL SOMEHOW THAT FALL KILLED HIM HOW AWKWARD IT WAS THIS LEONARDS I SUPPOSE AND HOW DID FRED GET OFF
1731-142320-0075 NOW COMES THE BAD PART SAID SHE NERVOUSLY TWINING HER FINGERS TOGETHER A POLICE INSPECTOR CAME AND TAXED ME WITH HAVING BEEN THE COMPANION OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE PUSH OR BLOW HAD OCCASIONED LEONARDS DEATH
1731-142320-0076 HE MIGHT BE SHOT ALL THIS FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND AND I SAID IT WAS NOT ME I WAS NOT AT THE RAILWAY STATION THAT NIGHT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT I HAD NO CONSCIENCE OR THOUGHT BUT TO SAVE FREDERICK I SAY IT WAS RIGHT I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
1731-142320-0077 YOU FORGOT YOURSELF IN THOUGHT FOR ANOTHER I HOPE I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME NO YOU WOULD NOT IT WAS WRONG DISOBEDIENT FAITHLESS AT THAT VERY TIME FRED WAS SAFELY OUT OF ENGLAND
1731-142320-0078 AND IN MY BLINDNESS I FORGOT THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER WITNESS WHO COULD TESTIFY TO MY BEING THERE WHO MISTER THORNTON YOU KNOW HE HAD SEEN ME CLOSE TO THE STATION WE HAD BOWED TO EACH OTHER WELL
1731-142320-0079 HE WOULD KNOW NOTHING OF THIS RIOT ABOUT THE DRUNKEN FELLOW'S DEATH I SUPPOSE THE INQUIRY NEVER CAME TO ANYTHING NO THE PROCEEDINGS THEY HAD BEGUN TO TALK ABOUT ON THE INQUEST WERE STOPPED MISTER THORNTON DID KNOW ALL ABOUT IT HE WAS A MAGISTRATE
1731-142320-0080 AND HE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS NOT THE FALL THAT HAD CAUSED THE DEATH BUT NOT BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT I HAD SAID OH MISTER BELL SHE SUDDENLY COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AS IF WISHING TO HIDE HERSELF FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE RECOLLECTION
1731-142320-0081 DID YOU HAVE ANY EXPLANATION WITH HIM DID YOU EVER TELL HIM THE STRONG INSTINCTIVE MOTIVE THE INSTINCTIVE WANT OF FAITH AND CLUTCHING AT A SIN TO KEEP MYSELF FROM SINKING SAID SHE BITTERLY NO HOW COULD I
1731-142320-0082 HE KNEW NOTHING OF FREDERICK TO PUT MYSELF TO RIGHTS IN HIS GOOD OPINION WAS I TO TELL HIM OF THE SECRETS OF OUR FAMILY INVOLVING AS THEY SEEMED TO DO THE CHANCES OF POOR FREDERICK'S ENTIRE EXCULPATION FRED'S LAST WORDS
1731-142320-0083 BUT HE MUST BE PERPLEXED IF THE AFFAIR HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE LEAST EXPLAINED THERE WAS FIRST YOUR WALKING OUT WITH A YOUNG MAN IN THE DARK BUT IT WAS MY BROTHER SAID MARGARET SURPRISED TRUE BUT HOW WAS HE TO KNOW THAT
1731-142320-0084 I DON'T KNOW I NEVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING OF THAT KIND SAID MARGARET REDDENING AND LOOKING HURT AND OFFENDED AND PERHAPS HE NEVER WOULD BUT FOR THE LIE WHICH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I MAINTAIN WAS NECESSARY
1731-142320-0085 THERE ARE MANY THINGS MORE UNLIKELY I SHOULD SAY REPLIED MISTER BELL BUT I BELIEVE I NEVER SHALL STILL SOMEHOW ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO HAVE SUNK SO LOW IN IN A FRIEND'S OPINION AS I HAVE DONE IN HIS
1731-142320-0086 HER EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS BUT HER VOICE WAS STEADY AND MISTER BELL WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER AND NOW THAT FREDERICK HAS GIVEN UP ALL HOPE AND ALMOST ALL WISH OF EVER CLEARING HIMSELF AND RETURNING TO ENGLAND
1731-142320-0087 AND TELL HIM ALSO THAT I GAVE YOU LEAVE TO DO SO BECAUSE I FELT THAT FOR PAPA'S SAKE I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO LOSE HIS RESPECT THOUGH WE MAY NEVER BE LIKELY TO MEET AGAIN CERTAINLY I THINK HE OUGHT TO KNOW
1731-142320-0088 I DO NOT LIKE YOU TO REST EVEN UNDER THE SHADOW OF AN IMPROPRIETY HE WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF SEEING YOU ALONE WITH A YOUNG MAN AS FOR THAT SAID MARGARET RATHER HAUGHTILY
1731-142320-0089 YET STILL I SHOULD CHOOSE TO HAVE IT EXPLAINED IF ANY NATURAL OPPORTUNITY FOR EASY EXPLANATION OCCURS BUT IT IS NOT TO CLEAR MYSELF OF ANY SUSPICION OF IMPROPER CONDUCT THAT I WISH TO HAVE HIM TOLD
1731-142320-0090 IF I THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SUSPECTED ME I SHOULD NOT CARE FOR HIS GOOD OPINION NO IT IS THAT HE MAY LEARN HOW I WAS TEMPTED AND HOW I FELL INTO THE SNARE WHY I TOLD THAT FALSEHOOD IN SHORT WHICH I DON'T BLAME
1731-142320-0091 YOU FOR IT IS NO PARTIALITY OF MINE I ASSURE YOU WHAT OTHER PEOPLE MAY THINK OF THE RIGHTNESS OR WRONGNESS IS NOTHING IN COMPARISON TO MY OWN DEEP KNOWLEDGE MY INNATE CONVICTION THAT IT WAS WRONG
1731-142320-0092 BUT WE WILL NOT TALK OF THAT ANY MORE IF YOU PLEASE IT IS DONE MY SIN IS SINNED I HAVE NOW TO PUT IT BEHIND ME AND BE TRUTHFUL FOR EVERMORE IF I CAN VERY WELL IF YOU LIKE TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE AND MORBID BE SO
1731-142320-0093 I ALWAYS KEEP MY CONSCIENCE AS TIGHT SHUT UP AS A JACK IN A BOX FOR WHEN IT JUMPS INTO EXISTENCE IT SURPRISES ME BY ITS SIZE SO I COAX IT DOWN AGAIN AS THE FISHERMAN COAXED THE GENIE
1731-142320-0094 WOULD YOU ONCE MORE COMPRESS YOURSELF INTO YOUR FORMER DIMENSIONS AND WHEN I'VE GOT HIM DOWN DON'T I CLAP THE SEAL ON THE VASE AND TAKE GOOD CARE HOW I OPEN IT AGAIN AND HOW I GO AGAINST SOLOMON WISEST OF MEN WHO CONFINED HIM THERE
1731-142320-0095 BUT IT WAS NO SMILING MATTER TO MARGARET SHE HARDLY ATTENDED TO WHAT MISTER BELL WAS SAYING HER THOUGHTS RAN UPON THE IDEA BEFORE ENTERTAINED BUT WHICH NOW HAD ASSUMED THE STRENGTH OF A CONVICTION
1731-142320-0096 FOR THAT AND ANY RETURN ON HER PART SHE HAD RESOLVED NEVER TO DWELL UPON AND SHE KEPT RIGIDLY TO HER RESOLUTION BUT IN THE RESPECT AND HIGH REGARD WHICH SHE HAD HOPED WOULD HAVE EVER MADE HIM WILLING IN THE SPIRIT OF GERALD GRIFFIN'S BEAUTIFUL LINES
1731-142320-0097 TO TURN AND LOOK BACK WHEN THOU HEAREST THE SOUND OF MY NAME SHE KEPT CHOKING AND SWALLOWING ALL THE TIME THAT SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT SHE TRIED TO COMFORT HERSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT WHAT HE IMAGINED HER TO BE DID NOT ALTER THE FACT OF WHAT SHE WAS
1731-142320-0098 BUT IT WAS A TRUISM A PHANTOM AND BROKE DOWN UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HER REGRET SHE HAD TWENTY QUESTIONS ON THE TIP OF HER TONGUE TO ASK MISTER BELL BUT NOT ONE OF THEM DID SHE UTTER MISTER BELL THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS TIRED AND SENT HER EARLY TO HER ROOM
1731-142320-0099 WHERE SHE SATE LONG HOURS BY THE OPEN WINDOW GAZING OUT ON THE PURPLE DOME ABOVE WHERE THE STARS AROSE AND TWINKLED AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE GREAT UMBRAGEOUS TREES BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED ALL NIGHT LONG TOO THERE BURNT A LITTLE LIGHT ON EARTH
1731-142320-0100 A CANDLE IN HER OLD BEDROOM WHICH WAS THE NURSERY WITH THE PRESENT INHABITANTS OF THE PARSONAGE UNTIL THE NEW ONE WAS BUILT A SENSE OF CHANGE OF INDIVIDUAL NOTHINGNESS OF PERPLEXITY AND DISAPPOINTMENT OVER POWERED MARGARET
1731-142320-0101 NOTHING HAD BEEN THE SAME AND THIS SLIGHT ALL PERVADING INSTABILITY HAD GIVEN HER GREATER PAIN THAN IF ALL HAD BEEN TOO ENTIRELY CHANGED FOR HER TO RECOGNISE IT I BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT HEAVEN MUST BE AND OH
1731-142320-0102 THE GRANDEUR AND REPOSE OF THE WORDS THE SAME YESTERDAY TO DAY AND FOR EVER EVERLASTING FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING THOU ART GOD THAT SKY ABOVE ME LOOKS AS THOUGH IT COULD NOT CHANGE AND YET IT WILL
1731-142320-0103 I AM SO TIRED SO TIRED OF BEING WHIRLED ON THROUGH ALL THESE PHASES OF MY LIFE IN WHICH NOTHING ABIDES BY ME NO CREATURE NO PLACE IT IS LIKE THE CIRCLE IN WHICH THE VICTIMS OF EARTHLY PASSION EDDY CONTINUALLY
1731-142320-0104 I AM IN THE MOOD IN WHICH WOMEN OF ANOTHER RELIGION TAKE THE VEIL I SEEK HEAVENLY STEADFASTNESS IN EARTHLY MONOTONY IF I WERE A ROMAN CATHOLIC AND COULD DEADEN MY HEART STUN IT WITH SOME GREAT BLOW I MIGHT BECOME A NUN
1731-142320-0105 IF THE WORLD STOOD STILL IT WOULD RETROGRADE AND BECOME CORRUPT IF THAT IS NOT IRISH LOOKING OUT OF MYSELF AND MY OWN PAINFUL SENSE OF CHANGE THE PROGRESS ALL AROUND ME IS RIGHT AND NECESSARY
1731-142320-0106 TO QUIVER DOWN TO HER LIPS SHE WENT INTO THE PARLOUR AND GREETED MISTER BELL AH MISSY YOU WERE UP LATE LAST NIGHT AND SO YOU'RE LATE THIS MORNING NOW I'VE GOT A LITTLE PIECE OF NEWS FOR YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK OF AN INVITATION TO DINNER
1731-142320-0107 A MORNING CALL LITERALLY IN THE DEWY MORNING WHY I'VE HAD THE VICAR HERE ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO THE SCHOOL HOW MUCH THE DESIRE OF GIVING OUR HOSTESS A TEETOTAL LECTURE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE HAYMAKERS HAD TO DO WITH HIS EARLINESS I DON'T KNOW
1731-142320-0108 BUT HERE HE WAS WHEN I CAME DOWN JUST BEFORE NINE AND WE ARE ASKED TO DINE THERE TO DAY BUT EDITH EXPECTS ME BACK I CANNOT GO SAID MARGARET THANKFUL TO HAVE SO GOOD AN EXCUSE
1731-142320-0109 STILL IT IS OPEN IF YOU WOULD LIKE IT OH NO SAID MARGARET LET US KEEP TO OUR PLAN LET US START AT TWELVE IT IS VERY GOOD AND KIND OF THEM BUT INDEED I COULD NOT GO VERY WELL DON'T FIDGET YOURSELF AND I'LL ARRANGE IT ALL
1731-142320-0110 BEFORE THEY LEFT MARGARET STOLE ROUND TO THE BACK OF THE VICARAGE GARDEN AND GATHERED A LITTLE STRAGGLING PIECE OF HONEYSUCKLE SHE WOULD NOT TAKE A FLOWER THE DAY BEFORE FOR FEAR OF BEING OBSERVED AND HER MOTIVES AND FEELINGS COMMENTED UPON
1731-142320-0111 BUT AS SHE RETURNED ACROSS THE COMMON THE PLACE WAS REINVESTED WITH THE OLD ENCHANTING ATMOSPHERE THE COMMON SOUNDS OF LIFE WERE MORE MUSICAL THERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD THE LIGHT MORE GOLDEN THE LIFE MORE TRANQUIL AND FULL OF DREAMY DELIGHT
1731-142320-0112 AS MARGARET REMEMBERED HER FEELINGS YESTERDAY SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND I TOO CHANGE PERPETUALLY NOW THIS NOW THAT NOW DISAPPOINTED AND PEEVISH BECAUSE ALL IS NOT EXACTLY AS I HAD PICTURED IT
