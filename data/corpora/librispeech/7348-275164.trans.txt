7348-275164-0000 THE CAPTAIN'S ATTENTION WAS FIRST ATTRACTED BY THE VISITOR WHOM HE FOUND IN THE ROOM HE BOWED TO THE STRANGER BUT THE FIRST IMPRESSION PRODUCED ON HIM DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN OF THE FAVORABLE KIND
7348-275164-0001 WHEN HE TURNED NEXT TO MISSUS PRESTY OBSERVING THAT SHE WAS AGITATED HE MADE THE CUSTOMARY APOLOGIES EXPRESSING HIS REGRET IF HE HAD BEEN SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO COMMIT AN INTRUSION
7348-275164-0002 TRUSTING IN THE GOOD SENSE AND GOOD BREEDING WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIM ON OTHER OCCASIONS MISSUS PRESTY ANTICIPATED THAT HE WOULD SEE THE PROPRIETY OF LEAVING HER ALONE AGAIN WITH THE PERSON WHOM HE HAD FOUND IN HER COMPANY
7348-275164-0003 TO HER DISMAY HE REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND WORSE STILL HE NOTICED HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENCE AND ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY SERIOUS CAUSE FOR IT FOR THE MOMENT
7348-275164-0004 MISSUS PRESTY WAS UNABLE TO REPLY HER PRESENCE OF MIND OR TO PUT IT MORE CORRECTLY HER READY AUDACITY DESERTED HER WHEN SHE SAW CATHERINE'S HUSBAND THAT HAD BEEN AND CATHERINE'S HUSBAND THAT WAS TO BE
7348-275164-0005 MEETING AS STRANGERS AND BUT TOO LIKELY TO DISCOVER EACH OTHER IN ALL HER EXPERIENCE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN PLACED IN SUCH A POSITION OF EMBARRASSMENT
7348-275164-0006 AS THE POSITION IN WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF NOW THE SENSE OF HONOR WHICH HAD PROMPTED CATHERINE'S RESOLUTION TO MAKE BENNYDECK ACQUAINTED WITH THE CATASTROPHE OF MARRIED LIFE MIGHT PLEAD HER EXCUSE
7348-275164-0007 IN THE ESTIMATION OF A MAN DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HER BUT IF THE CAPTAIN WAS FIRST INFORMED THAT HE HAD BEEN DECEIVED BY A PERSON WHO WAS A PERFECT STRANGER TO HIM WHAT HOPE COULD BE ENTERTAINED
7348-275164-0008 OF HIS STILL HOLDING HIMSELF BOUND BY HIS MARRIAGE ENGAGEMENT IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE
7348-275164-0009 HE MUST CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD A MAN'S VOICE RAISED IN ANGER WHEN HE APPROACHED THE DOOR AND HE WAS NOW OBSERVING THAT MAN WITH AN AIR OF CURIOSITY WHICH WAS ALREADY ASSUMING THE APPEARANCE OF DISTRUST
7348-275164-0010 THAT HERBERT ON HIS SIDE RESENTED THE CAPTAIN'S CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF HIM WAS PLAINLY VISIBLE IN HIS FACE AFTER A GLANCE AT BENNYDECK HE ASKED MISSUS PRESTY
7348-275164-0011 WHO THAT GENTLEMAN WAS I MAY BE MISTAKEN HE ADDED BUT I THOUGHT YOUR FRIEND LOOKED AT ME JUST NOW AS IF HE KNEW ME I HAVE MET YOU SIR BEFORE THIS
7348-275164-0012 THE CAPTAIN MADE THE REPLY WITH A COURTEOUS COMPOSURE OF TONE AND MANNER WHICH APPARENTLY REMINDED HERBERT OF THE CLAIMS OF POLITENESS MAY I ASK WHERE I HAD THE HONOR OF SEEING YOU HE INQUIRED
7348-275164-0013 WE PASSED EACH OTHER IN THE HALL OF THE HOTEL AT SANDYSEAL YOU HAD A YOUNG WOMAN WITH YOU YOUR MEMORY IS A BETTER ONE THAN MINE SIR I FAIL TO REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO WHICH YOU REFER
7348-275164-0014 BENNYDECK LET THE MATTER REST THERE STRUCK BY THE REMARKABLE APPEARANCE OF EMBARRASSMENT IN MISSUS PRESTY'S MANNER AND FEELING IN SPITE OF HERBERT'S POLITENESS OF LANGUAGE
7348-275164-0015 INCREASED DISTRUST OF THE MAN WHOM HE HAD FOUND VISITING HER HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT NOT BE AMISS TO HINT THAT SHE COULD RELY ON HIM IN CASE OF NECESSITY I AM AFRAID
7348-275164-0016 I HAVE INTERRUPTED A CONFIDENTIAL INTERVIEW HE BEGAN AND I OUGHT PERHAPS TO EXPLAIN MISSUS PRESTY LISTENED ABSENTLY PREOCCUPIED BY THE FEAR THAT HERBERT WOULD PROVOKE A DANGEROUS DISCLOSURE
7348-275164-0017 AND BY THE DIFFICULTY OF DISCOVERING A MEANS OF PREVENTING IT SHE INTERRUPTED THE CAPTAIN EXCUSE ME FOR ONE MOMENT I HAVE A WORD TO SAY TO THIS GENTLEMAN BENNYDECK IMMEDIATELY DREW BACK
7348-275164-0018 AND MISSUS PRESTY LOWERED HER VOICE IF YOU WISH TO SEE KITTY SHE RESUMED ATTACKING HERBERT ON HIS WEAK SIDE IT DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON YOUR DISCRETION
7348-275164-0019 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DISCRETION BE CAREFUL NOT TO SPEAK OF OUR FAMILY TROUBLES AND I PROMISE YOU SHALL SEE KITTY THAT IS WHAT I MEAN
7348-275164-0020 HERBERT DECLINED TO SAY WHETHER HE WOULD BE CAREFUL OR NOT HE WAS DETERMINED TO FIND OUT FIRST WITH WHAT PURPOSE BENNYDECK HAD ENTERED THE ROOM
7348-275164-0021 HE SAID TO MISSUS PRESTY WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY SHE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SUBMIT IN APPEARANCE AT LEAST NEVER HAD SHE HATED HERBERT
7348-275164-0022 AS SHE HATED HIM AT THAT MOMENT THE CAPTAIN WENT ON WITH HIS EXPLANATION HE HAD HIS REASONS HE SAID FOR HESITATING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO PRESENT HIMSELF UNINVITED
7348-275164-0023 AND HE ACCORDINGLY RETIRED ON SECOND THOUGHTS HOWEVER HE HAD RETURNED IN THE HOPE IN THE HOPE HERBERT INTERPOSED OF SEEING MISSUS PRESTY'S DAUGHTER THAT WAS ONE OF MY MOTIVES
7348-275164-0024 BENNYDECK ANSWERED IS IT INDISCREET TO INQUIRE WHAT THE OTHER MOTIVE WAS NOT AT ALL I HEARD A STRANGER'S VOICE SPEAKING IN A TONE WHICH TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT
7348-275164-0025 IS NOT CUSTOMARY IN A LADY'S ROOM AND I THOUGHT HERBERT INTERRUPTED HIM AGAIN AND YOU THOUGHT YOUR INTERFERENCE MIGHT BE WELCOME TO THE LADY AM I RIGHT QUITE RIGHT
7348-275164-0026 AM I MAKING ANOTHER LUCKY GUESS IF I SUPPOSE MYSELF TO BE SPEAKING TO CAPTAIN BENNYDECK I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR SIR HOW YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY NAME
7348-275164-0027 SHALL WE SAY CAPTAIN THAT I HAVE ARRIVED AT IT BY INSTINCT HIS FACE AS HE MADE THAT REPLY ALARMED MISSUS PRESTY
7348-275164-0028 SHE CAST A LOOK AT HIM PARTLY OF ENTREATY PARTLY OF WARNING NO EFFECT WAS PRODUCED BY THE LOOK HE CONTINUED IN A TONE OF IRONICAL COMPLIMENT
7348-275164-0029 YOU MUST PAY THE PENALTY OF BEING A PUBLIC CHARACTER YOUR MARRIAGE IS ANNOUNCED IN THE NEWSPAPERS I SELDOM READ THE NEWSPAPERS AH INDEED
7348-275164-0030 PERHAPS THE REPORT IS NOT TRUE AS YOU DON'T READ THE NEWSPAPERS ALLOW ME TO REPEAT IT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO MARRY THE BEAUTIFUL WIDOW MISSUS NORMAN
7348-275164-0031 I THINK I QUOTE THOSE LAST WORDS CORRECTLY MISSUS PRESTY SUDDENLY GOT UP WITH AN INSCRUTABLE FACE THAT TOLD NO TALES SHE ADVANCED TO THE DOOR
7348-275164-0032 HERBERT'S INSANE JEALOUSY OF THE MAN WHO WAS ABOUT TO BECOME CATHERINE'S HUSBAND HAD LED HIM INTO A SERIOUS ERROR HE HAD DRIVEN CATHERINE'S MOTHER TO DESPERATION IN THAT STATE OF MIND
7348-275164-0033 SHE RECOVERED HER LOST AUDACITY AS A MATTER OF COURSE OPENING THE DOOR SHE TURNED ROUND TO THE TWO MEN WITH A MAGNIFICENT IMPUDENCE OF MANNER WHICH IN HER HAPPIEST MOMENTS SHE HAD NEVER SURPASSED
7348-275164-0034 I AM SORRY TO INTERRUPT THIS INTERESTING CONVERSATION SHE SAID BUT I HAVE STUPIDLY FORGOTTEN ONE OF MY DOMESTIC DUTIES YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO RETURN AND LISTEN WITH RENEWED PLEASURE
7348-275164-0035 WHEN MY HOUSEHOLD BUSINESS IS OFF MY MIND I SHALL HOPE TO FIND YOU BOTH MORE POLITE TO EACH OTHER THAN EVER WHEN I COME BACK SHE WAS IN SUCH A FRENZY OF SUPPRESSED RAGE
7348-275164-0036 THAT SHE ACTUALLY KISSED HER HAND TO THEM AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM BENNYDECK LOOKED AFTER HER CONVINCED THAT SOME SINISTER PURPOSE WAS CONCEALED UNDER MISSUS PRESTY'S FALSE EXCUSES
7348-275164-0037 AND WHOLLY UNABLE TO IMAGINE WHAT THAT PURPOSE MIGHT BE HERBERT STILL PERSISTED IN TRYING TO FORCE A QUARREL ON THE CAPTAIN AS I REMARKED JUST NOW
7348-275164-0038 HE PROCEEDED NEWSPAPER REPORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS TO BE TRUSTED DO YOU SERIOUSLY MEAN MY DEAR SIR TO MARRY MISSUS NORMAN I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT HONOR AND THAT HAPPINESS
7348-275164-0039 BUT I AM AT A LOSS TO KNOW HOW IT INTERESTS YOU IN THAT CASE ALLOW ME TO ENLIGHTEN YOU MY NAME IS HERBERT LINLEY HE HAD HELD HIS NAME IN RESERVE
7348-275164-0040 FEELING CERTAIN OF THE EFFECT WHICH HE WOULD PRODUCE WHEN HE PRONOUNCED IT THE RESULT TOOK HIM COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE NOT THE SLIGHTEST APPEARANCE OF AGITATION SHOWED ITSELF IN BENNYDECK'S MANNER
7348-275164-0041 ON THE CONTRARY HE LOOKED AS IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT INTERESTED HIM IN THE DISCOVERY OF THE NAME YOU ARE PROBABLY RELATED TO A FRIEND OF MINE HE SAID QUIETLY
7348-275164-0042 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND MISTER RANDAL LINLEY HERBERT WAS ENTIRELY UNPREPARED FOR THIS DISCOVERY ONCE MORE THE CAPTAIN HAD GOT THE BEST OF IT
7348-275164-0043 ARE YOU AND RANDAL LINLEY INTIMATE FRIENDS HE INQUIRED AS SOON AS HE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF MOST INTIMATE IT'S STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED ME
7348-275164-0044 ON ANY OCCASION WHEN YOU AND HE WERE TOGETHER IT DOES INDEED SEEM STRANGE HERBERT PAUSED HIS BROTHER'S KEEN SENSE OF THE DISGRACE
7348-275164-0045 THAT HE HAD INFLICTED ON THE FAMILY RECURRED TO HIS MEMORY HE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND RANDAL'S OTHERWISE UNACCOUNTABLE SILENCE ARE YOU NEARLY RELATED TO MISTER RANDAL LINLEY THE CAPTAIN ASKED
7348-275164-0046 I AM HIS ELDER BROTHER IGNORANT ON HIS PART OF THE FAMILY DISGRACE BENNYDECK HEARD THAT REPLY WITH AMAZEMENT FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW
7348-275164-0047 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOUNT FOR RANDAL'S SILENCE WILL YOU THINK ME VERY INQUISITIVE HERBERT RESUMED IF I ASK WHETHER MY BROTHER APPROVES OF YOUR MARRIAGE
7348-275164-0048 THERE WAS A CHANGE IN HIS TONE AS HE PUT THAT QUESTION WHICH WARNED BENNYDECK TO BE ON HIS GUARD I HAVE NOT YET CONSULTED MY FRIEND'S OPINION HE ANSWERED SHORTLY
7348-275164-0049 HERBERT THREW OFF THE MASK IN THE MEANTIME YOU SHALL HAVE MY OPINION HE SAID YOUR MARRIAGE IS A CRIME AND I MEAN TO PREVENT IT
7348-275164-0050 THE CAPTAIN LEFT HIS CHAIR AND STERNLY FACED THE MAN WHO HAD SPOKEN THOSE INSOLENT WORDS ARE YOU MAD HE ASKED
7348-275164-0051 HERBERT WAS ON THE POINT OF DECLARING HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN CATHERINE'S HUSBAND UNTIL THE LAW DISSOLVED THEIR MARRIAGE WHEN A WAITER CAME IN AND APPROACHED HIM WITH A MESSAGE
7348-275164-0052 YOU ARE WANTED IMMEDIATELY SIR WHO WANTS ME A PERSON OUTSIDE SIR IT'S A SERIOUS MATTER THERE IS NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE
7348-275164-0053 HERBERT TURNED TO THE CAPTAIN I MUST HAVE YOUR PROMISE TO WAIT FOR ME HE SAID OR I DON'T LEAVE THE ROOM MAKE YOUR MIND EASY
7348-275164-0054 I SHALL NOT STIR FROM THIS PLACE TILL YOU HAVE EXPLAINED YOURSELF WAS THE FIRM REPLY THE SERVANT LED THE WAY OUT HE CROSSED THE PASSAGE AND OPENED THE DOOR OF A WAITING ROOM
