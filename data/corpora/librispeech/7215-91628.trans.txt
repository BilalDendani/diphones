7215-91628-0027 FOR YOU KNOW I'M NOT SUBJECT TO HAVING COMMON SENSE AND I PROMISE YOU I'LL NEVER HAVE IT AGAIN IN MY LIFE WHAT WAS AMUSING WAS THAT WHILE I WAS HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH HIM HE CARRIED OUT THE PANTOMIME HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN
7215-91628-0028 STUCK HIS FACE AGAINST THE GROUND AND SEEMED TO HOLD BETWEEN HIS TWO HANDS THE TOE OF A SLIPPER HE WAS CRYING AND SOBBING THE WORDS YES MY LITTLE QUEEN YES I DO PROMISE I'LL NEVER HAVE IT IN MY LIFE NEVER
7215-91628-0029 THEN HE GOT UP QUICKLY AND ADDED IN A SERIOUS AND DELIBERATE TONE HIM YES YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THAT WOULD BE BEST SHE'S A GOOD WOMAN MISTER VIELLARD SAYS THAT SHE IS SO KIND
7215-91628-0030 AND I KNOW A LITTLE BIT THAT SHE IS NONETHELESS TO GO HUMILIATE ONESELF IN FRONT OF AN UGLY BITCH TO CRY FOR PITY AT THE FEET OF A MISERABLE LITTLE ACTRESS WHO'S ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY THE HISSING FROM THE THEATRE STALLS ME

7215-91628-0035 THERE MUST BE A CERTAIN DIGNITY ATTACHED TO HUMAN NATURE WHICH NOTHING CAN EXTINGUISH THE MOST TRIVIAL THING WILL AWAKEN IT SOMETHING TRIFLING THERE ARE OTHER DAYS WHEN IT WOULD COST ME NOTHING TO BE AS VILE AS ANYONE COULD WISH
7215-91628-0036 ON THOSE DAYS FOR A PENNY I'D KISS THE ASS OF THE LITTLE HUS GIRL ME BUT MY FRIEND SHE'S WHITE PRETTY YOUNG SOFT CHUBBY IT'S AN ACT OF HUMILITY
7215-91628-0037 THAT EVEN A MAN MORE REFINED THAN YOU COULD SOMETIMES STOOP TO HIM LET'S UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER THERE'S LITERAL ASS KISSING AND METAPHORICAL ASS KISSING
7215-91628-0038 ASK FAT BERGIER WHO KISSES THE ASS OF MADAME DE LA MARK BOTH LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY MY GOD WITH THEM THE LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE DISGUST ME EQUALLY ME

7215-91628-0040 AND THEN CONTEMPT FOR ONESELF THAT'S UNBEARABLE ME DO YOU KNOW THAT FEELING HIM DO I KNOW IT HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I SAID TO MYSELF
7215-91628-0041 HOW COME THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND FINE TABLES IN PARIS EACH WITH FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PLACES AND THERE'S NO PLACE FOR YOU THERE ARE PURSES FULL OF GOLD SPILLING OVER LEFT AND RIGHT AND NO PIECE FALLS ON YOU
7215-91628-0042 A THOUSAND FINE HALF WITS WITHOUT TALENT OR MERIT A THOUSAND TINY CREATURES WITHOUT CHARM A THOUSAND INSIPID SCHEMERS ARE WELL DRESSED AND YOU'D WALK AROUND NAKED
7215-91628-0043 COULDN'T YOU LIE SWEAR FORSWEAR PROMISE AND THEN PERFORM OR FAIL TO PERFORM LIKE EVERYONE ELSE COULDN'T YOU CRAWL ON HANDS AND KNEES LIKE THE OTHERS

7215-91628-0046 BEAUTY SPOTS A TRAIN CARRIED BEHIND YOU TO A BALL TO A BALL TO THE OPERA TO THE THEATRE HER HEART IS ALREADY QUIVERING WITH JOY YOU PLAY WITH A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS
7215-91628-0047 IT'S A LETTER FOR WHOM FOR YOU IF YOU ARE AT ALL CURIOUS CURIOUS I'M REALLY CURIOUS LET'S SEE IT SHE READS A MEETING THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
7215-91628-0048 PERHAPS WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO MASS MAMMA ALWAYS COMES WITH ME BUT IF HE CAME HERE EARLY IN THE MORNING I GET UP FIRST AND I'M AT THE COUNTER BEFORE THEY GET UP HE COMES HE IS PLEASING
7215-91628-0049 HOW COME YOU POSSESS SUCH TALENT AND ARE SHORT OF BREAD YOU WRETCHED MAN AREN'T YOU ASHAMED I REMEMBER A GROUP OF SCOUNDRELS WHO COULDN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO ME AND WHO WERE LOADED WITH MONEY I WAS IN A BUCKRAM OVERCOAT
7215-91628-0050 AND THEY WERE DRESSED IN VELVET LEANING ON GOLD HEADED CANES SHAPED LIKE RAVENS BEAKS WITH PICTURES OF ARISTOTLE OR PLATO ON CAMEO RINGS ON THEIR FINGERS BUT WHO WERE THEY FOR THE MOST PART THEY WERE INCOMPETENT MUSICIANS NOWADAYS A SORT OF NOBILITY
7215-91628-0051 RAISED MY SPIRITS MADE MY MIND MORE SUBTLE CAPABLE OF EVERYTHING BUT THESE HAPPY STATES OF MIND APPARENTLY DIDN'T LAST BECAUSE UP TO NOW I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE ANY HEADWAY WHATEVER THE CASE THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF MY FREQUENT SOLILOQUIES
7215-91628-0052 WHICH YOU CAN PARAPHRASE HOWEVER YOU LIKE PROVIDED YOU CONCLUDE FROM THEM THAT I UNDERSTAND DISGUST FOR ONESELF OR THE TORMENT OF CONSCIENCE WHICH ARISES FROM THE USELESSNESS OF THE GIFTS GIVEN TO US BY HEAVEN IT'S THE CRUELEST THING OF ALL
7215-91628-0053 I LISTENED TO HIM WHILE HE WAS ACTING OUT THE SCENE OF THE PROCURER AND THE YOUNG GIRL BEING SEDUCED I WAS PULLED IN TWO OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
7215-91628-0054 I WAS PERPLEXED
7215-91628-0055 TWENTY TIMES THE ANGER ARISING AT THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART ENDED IN A BURST OF LAUGHTER I WAS TAKEN ABACK BY SO MUCH CLEVERNESS AND BASE BEHAVIOUR BY SUCH VALID IDEAS ALTERNATING WITH FALSE ONES
7215-91628-0056 BY SUCH A GENERAL PERVERSITY OF FEELING AND SUCH COMPLETE DEPRAVITY AND SUCH RARE FRANKNESS HE NOTICED THE CONFLICT GOING ON INSIDE ME WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU HE SAID ME NOTHING
7215-91628-0057 HIM YOU SEEM UPSET ME WELL I AM HIM WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO ME CHANGE THE SUBJECT
7215-91628-0058 YOU POOR MAN TO BE BORN OR FALL INTO SUCH A DEBASED CONDITION HIM
7215-91628-0059 HOWEVER DON'T LET MY CONDITION AFFECT YOU TOO MUCH
7215-91628-0060 FROM THOSE PEOPLE I'VE SAVED UP SOMETHING REMEMBER THAT I DIDN'T NEED ANYTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND THEY GAVE ME A CONSIDERABLE ALLOWANCE FOR MY TRIFLING PLEASURES THEN HE BEGAN HITTING HIS FOREHEAD AGAIN WITH ONE OF HIS FISTS
7215-91628-0061 BITING HIS LIP ROLLING HIS WILD EYES UP TO THE CEILING COMMENTING BUT THAT BUSINESS IS OVER AND DONE WITH I'VE SET SOMETHING ASIDE TIME HAS GONE BY IT'S ALWAYS THAT MUCH MORE OF A GAIN ME
7215-91628-0062 YOU MEAN MORE OF A LOSS HIM NO NO MORE OF A GAIN WE BECOME RICHER EVERY MOMENT
7215-91628-0063 IT'S ALL ONE THE IMPORTANT POINT IS TO KEEP EMPTYING ONE'S BOWELS EASILY FREELY PLEASURABLY COPIOUSLY EVERY NIGHT O STERCUS PRETIOSUM THAT'S THE GRAND RESULT OF LIFE IN ALL CONDITIONS
7215-91628-0064 SAMUEL BERNARD WHO BY DINT OF ROBBERY PILLAGING AND BANKRUPTCIES LEAVES TWENTY SEVEN MILLION IN GOLD
7215-91628-0065 WHO WON'T LEAVE ANYTHING RAMEAU FOR WHOM CHARITY WILL PROVIDE A FLOOR CLOTH AS A SHROUD TO WRAP HIM IN A DEAD MAN DOESN'T HEAR THE BELLS TOLLING
7215-91628-0066 IT'S A WASTE OF TIME FOR ONE HUNDRED PRIESTS TO SHOUT THEMSELVES HOARSE ON HIS BEHALF OR FOR HIM TO BE PRECEDED AND FOLLOWED BY A LONG LINE OF BURNING TORCHES HIS SOUL DOES NOT WALK ALONGSIDE THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES TO ROT UNDER MARBLE OR TO ROT UNDER THE EARTH
7215-91628-0067 IT'S STILL ROTTING TO HAVE AROUND YOUR COFFIN CHOIRBOYS IN RED AND CHOIRBOYS IN BLUE OR NONE AT ALL WHAT DOES THAT MATTER TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THIS WRIST IT USED TO BE STIFF AS THE DEVIL
7215-91628-0068 THESE TEN FINGERS WERE LIKE SO MANY STICKS STUCK INTO A WOODEN METACARPAL AND THESE TENDONS WERE OLD CORDS OF CATGUT
7215-91628-0069 BUT I'VE TORMENTED BROKEN AND ABUSED THEM SO MUCH YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE BUT BY GOD I SAY THAT YOU WILL AND THAT'S THAT AS HE SAID THIS
7215-91628-0070 WITH HIS RIGHT HAND HE GRABBED THE FINGERS AND WRIST OF HIS LEFT HAND AND BENT THEM BACK AND FORTH THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS WERE TOUCHING HIS ARM HIS JOINTS WERE CRACKING I WAS AFRAID HE'D END UP DISLOCATING THE BONES ME
7215-91628-0071 BE CAREFUL I SAY TO HIM YOU'RE GOING TO HURT YOURSELF HIM DON'T WORRY THEY CAN STAND IT
7215-91628-0072 WHATEVER THEY FELT LIKE THE LITTLE BUGGERS HAD TO GET USED TO IT AND LEARN TO STRIKE THE KEYS AND FLY OVER THE STRINGS SO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE WORKING YES THEY'RE WORKING FINE AT THAT MOMENT HE TAKES ON THE POSE OF A VIOLIN PLAYER
7215-91628-0073 HE HUMS AN ALLEGRO FROM LOCATELLI AND HIS RIGHT ARM IMITATES THE MOVEMENT OF THE BOW WHILE HIS LEFT HAND AND HIS FINGERS SEEM TO MOVE ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE NECK IF HE HITS A WRONG NOTE HE STOPS
7215-91628-0074 TIGHTENS OR LOOSENS THE STRING AND PLUCKS THE STRING WITH HIS NAIL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S JUST RIGHT HE RESUMES PLAYING THE PIECE WHERE HE HAS STOPPED HE KEEPS TIME WITH HIS FEET AND THRASHES ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD FEET HANDS ARMS AND BODY
7215-91628-0075 PERHAPS AT SOME CONCERT OF SPIRITUAL MUSIC YOU'VE HAD OCCASION TO SEE FERRARI OR CHIABRAN OR SOME OTHER VIRTUOSO IN THE SAME SORT OF CONVULSIONS PRESENTING A PICTURE OF THE SAME TORTURE THAT GIVES ME ALMOST AS MUCH PAIN
7215-91628-0076 FOR SURELY IT'S AGONIZING TO WATCH THE TORMENT OF SOMEONE WHO IS BUSY GIVING ME A REPRESENTATION OF PLEASURE IF HE SIMPLY HAS TO SHOW ME A PATIENT UNDER TORTURE THEN DRAW A CURTAIN BETWEEN THE MAN AND ME SOMETHING TO CONCEAL ME
7215-91628-0077 IN THE MIDST OF HIS AGITATION AND CRIES IF THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN THE NOTE HAD TO BE HELD ONE OF THOSE HARMONIOUS SPOTS WHEN THE BOW IS DRAWN SLOWLY ACROSS SEVERAL STRINGS AT ONCE HIS FACE TOOK ON AN ECSTATIC EXPRESSION HIS VOICE SOFTENED
7215-91628-0078 AND HE LISTENED IN RAPTURE HE WAS SURE THE HARMONY WAS RESONATING IN HIS EARS AND MINE THEN PLACING HIS INSTRUMENT UNDER HIS LEFT ARM USING THE SAME HAND HE WAS HOLDING IT WITH AND LETTING HIS RIGHT HAND HOLDING THE BOW FALL HE SAID
7215-91628-0079 WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ME WONDERFUL HIM THAT WAS ALL RIGHT I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDED ALMOST LIKE THE OTHERS
7215-91628-0080 ALL AT ONCE HE CROUCHES DOWN LIKE A MUSICIAN SITTING DOWN AT A KEYBOARD I SAY TO HIM HAVE MERCY ON YOURSELF AND ME HIM NO NO SINCE I'VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION YOU'LL LISTEN
7215-91628-0081 YOU'LL PRAISE ME WITH A MORE CONFIDENT TONE AND THAT MIGHT BE WORTH ANOTHER PUPIL TO ME ME I DON'T GO OUT VERY MUCH AND YOU'RE GOING TO EXHAUST YOURSELF TO NO PURPOSE HIM
7215-91628-0082 I'M NEVER TIRED SINCE I SAW THAT MY WISH TO PITY THE MAN WAS USELESS FOR THE VIOLIN SONATA HAD LEFT HIM BATHED IN SWEAT I DECIDED TO LET HIM DO WHAT HE WANTED SO THERE HE WAS SEATED AT THE KEYBOARD
7215-91628-0083 HIS LEGS BENT HIS HEAD RAISED TOWARDS THE CEILING WHERE ONE WOULD HAVE SAID HE WAS LOOKING AT A WRITTEN MUSICAL SCORE SINGING PLAYING A PRELUDE WORKING THROUGH A PIECE BY ALBERTI OR GALUPPI I DON'T KNOW WHICH OF THE TWO HIS VOICE WENT LIKE THE WIND
7215-91628-0084 AND HIS FINGERS FLEW ACROSS THE KEYS SOMETIMES ABANDONING THE UPPER PART TO PLAY THE BASS SOMETIMES ABANDONING THE ACCOMPANIMENT TO RETURN TO THE UPPER REGISTER A SERIES OF EMOTIONS WENT IN SUCCESSION ACROSS HIS FACE YOU COULD SEE THERE TENDERNESS
7215-91628-0085 ANGER PLEASURE SADNESS YOU COULD FEEL THE SOFT NOTES AND THE LOUD ONES I'M SURE THAT SOMEONE MORE ASTUTE THAN MYSELF WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE PIECE FROM THE MOVEMENT AND STYLE
7215-91628-0086 FROM HIS EXPRESSIONS AND FROM SOME SNATCHES OF MELODY COMING OUT OF HIM NOW AND THEN BUT WHAT WAS REALLY STRANGE WAS THAT FROM TIME TO TIME HE GROPED AROUND AND STARTED AGAIN AS IF HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND WAS UPSET AT HIMSELF FOR NOT HAVING THE PIECE AT HIS FINGER TIPS
7215-91628-0087 FINALLY HE STRAIGHTENED UP WIPED THE BEADS OF SWEAT RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND SAID YOU SEE THAT WE ALSO KNOW HOW TO PLAY A TRITONE OR AN AUGMENTED FIFTH AND THAT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH TRANSITIONS OF DOMINANTS
