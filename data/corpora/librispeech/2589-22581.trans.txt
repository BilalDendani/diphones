2589-22581-0000 BETWIXT THE SELF IMPORTANCE OF THE OVERWEENING YOKELS AND THE INVENTIVE FACULTIES OF TOM FOOL ALL THE EVENING ONE STANDING IN ANY OPEN SPOT OF THE CASTLE MIGHT HAVE HEARD NOW ON THE ONE NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE
2589-22581-0001 RENEWED BURSTS OF MERRIMENT RIPPLE THE AIR BUT AS THE STILL AUTUMN NIGHT CREPT ON THE INTERVALS BETWEEN GREW LONGER AND LONGER UNTIL AT LENGTH ALL SOUNDS CEASED AND SILENCE TOOK UP HER ANCIENT REIGN
2589-22581-0002 IN A TIME WHEN SUCH LUDIFICATIONS WERE NOT YET CONSIDERED UNSUITABLE TO THE DIGNITY OF THE HIGHEST POSITION THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER OF HIS HOUSEHOLD HAD THROUGH IT ALL SHOWED A COUNTENANCE IN WHICH ALTHOUGH EYES LIPS
2589-22581-0003 AND VOICE SHARED IN THE LAUGHTER THERE YET LURKED A THOUGHTFUL DOUBT CONCERNING THE RESULT FOR HE KNEW THAT IN SOME SHAPE OR OTHER AND THAT CERTAINLY NOT THE TRUE ONE THE AFFAIR WOULD BE SPREAD OVER THE COUNTRY
2589-22581-0004 WHERE NOW PREJUDICE AGAINST THE CATHOLICS WAS STRONG AND DANGEROUS IN PROPORTION TO THE UNREASON OF THOSE WHO CHERISHED IT NOW ALSO IT WAS BECOMING PRETTY PLAIN THAT EXCEPT THE KING YIELDED EVERY PREROGATIVE
2589-22581-0005 AND BECAME THE PUPPET WHICH THE MINGLED PRIDE AND APPREHENSION OF THE PARLIAMENT WOULD HAVE HIM THEIR DIFFERENCES MUST ERE LONG BE REFERRED TO THE ARBITRATION OF THE SWORD IN WHICH CASE THERE WAS NO SHADOW OF DOUBT IN THE MIND OF THE EARL
2589-22581-0006 AS TO THE PART BEFITTING A PEER OF THE REALM THE KING WAS A PROTESTANT BUT NO LESS THE KING AND NOT THIS MAN BUT HIS PARENTS HAD SINNED IN FORSAKING THE CHURCH OF WHICH SIN THEIR OFFSPRING HAD NOW TO BEAR THE PENALTY
2589-22581-0007 REAPING THE WHIRLWIND SPRUNG FROM THE STORMY SEEDS BY THEM SOWN FOR WHAT WERE THE PURITANS BUT THE LAWFULLY BEGOTTEN CHILDREN OF THE SO CALLED REFORMATION WHOSE SPIRIT THEY INHERITED AND IN WHOSE FOOTSTEPS THEY SO CLOSELY FOLLOWED
2589-22581-0008 FAIL OR SPEED IN ANY RESULT SO LONG AS HIS CASTLE HELD TOGETHER IT SHOULD STAND FOR THE KING FAITHFUL CATHOLIC AS HE WAS THE BRAVE OLD MAN WAS ENGLISH TO THE BACKBONE AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE
2589-22581-0009 THIS VISIT OF SEARCH LET IT HAVE ORIGINATED HOW IT MIGHT AND BE AS DESPICABLE IN ITSELF AS IT WAS LUDICROUS IN ITS RESULT SHOWED BUT TOO CLEARLY HOW STRONG THE CURRENT OF POPULAR FEELING WAS SETTING AGAINST ALL THE MOUNDS OF SOCIAL DISTINCTION
2589-22581-0010 AND NOT KINGLY PREROGATIVE ALONE WHAT PREPARATIONS MIGHT BE NEEDFUL MUST BE PRUDENT THAT SAME NIGHT THEN LONG AFTER THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED THREE MEN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A FINE HALF MOON
