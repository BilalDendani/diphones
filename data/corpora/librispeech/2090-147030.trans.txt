2090-147030-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE FINGER PRINTS TARLING HIS HANDS THRUST INTO HIS POCKETS HIS CHIN DROPPED HIS SHOULDERS BENT SLOWLY WALKED THE BROAD PAVEMENT OF THE EDGWARE ROAD
2090-147030-0001 ON HIS WAY FROM THE GIRL'S HOTEL TO HIS FLAT HE DISMISSED WITH GOOD REASON THE NOT UNIMPORTANT FACT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECT HE A COMPARATIVELY UNKNOWN DETECTIVE FROM SHANGHAI WAS BY REASON OF HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THORNTON LYNE
2090-147030-0002 AND EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE HIS OWN REVOLVER HAD BEEN FOUND ON THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY THE OBJECT OF SOME SUSPICION ON THE PART OF THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES WHO CERTAINLY WOULD NOT POOH POOH THE SUGGESTION THAT HE WAS INNOCENT OF ANY ASSOCIATION WITH THE CRIME
2090-147030-0003 BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO BE ENGAGED IN THE CASE HE KNEW THAT THE WHOLE COMPLEX MACHINERY OF SCOTLAND YARD WAS WORKING AND WORKING AT TOP SPEED TO IMPLICATE HIM IN THE TRAGEDY SILENT AND INVISIBLE THOUGH THAT WORK MAY BE
2090-147030-0004 IT WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE SURE HE SMILED A LITTLE AND SHRUGGED HIMSELF FROM THE CATEGORY OF THE SUSPECTED
2090-147030-0005 THAT THORNTON LYNE HAD LOVED HER HE DID NOT FOR ONE MOMENT IMAGINE THORNTON LYNE WAS NOT THE KIND OF MAN WHO LOVED RATHER HAD HE DESIRED AND VERY FEW WOMEN HAD THWARTED HIM
2090-147030-0006 TARLING ONLY KNEW OF THE SCENE WHICH HAD OCCURRED BETWEEN LYNE AND THE GIRL ON THE DAY HE HAD BEEN CALLED IN BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY OTHER PAINFUL INTERVIEWS PAINFUL FOR THE GIRL HUMILIATING FOR THE DEAD MILLIONAIRE ANYWAY HE THOUGHT THANKFULLY IT WOULD NOT BE ODETTE
2090-147030-0007 HE COULD RULE HER OUT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY SHE COULD NOT BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE WHEN THORNTON LYNE WAS DISCOVERED IN HYDE PARK WITH ODETTE RIDER'S NIGHT DRESS ROUND ABOUT HIS WOUND
2090-147030-0008 BUT WHAT OF MILBURGH THAT SUAVE AND OILY MAN TARLING RECALLED THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN SENT FOR BY HIS DEAD RELATIVE TO INQUIRE INTO MILBURGH'S MODE OF LIVING AND THAT MILBURGH WAS UNDER SUSPICION OF HAVING ROBBED THE FIRM
2090-147030-0009 SUPPOSE MILBURGH HAD COMMITTED THE CRIME SUPPOSE TO HIDE HIS DEFALCATIONS
2090-147030-0010 BECAUSE THE DEATH OF THORNTON LYNE WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO PRECIPITATE THE DISCOVERY OF THE MANAGER'S EMBEZZLEMENTS
2090-147030-0011 MILBURGH HIMSELF WAS NOT UNMINDFUL OF THIS ARGUMENT IN HIS FAVOUR AS WAS TO BE REVEALED AS AGAINST THIS TARLING THOUGHT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT CRIMINALS DID FOOLISH THINGS
2090-147030-0012 THEY TOOK LITTLE OR NO ACCOUNT OF THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACT AND A MAN LIKE MILBURGH IN HIS DESPERATION MIGHT IN HIS VERY FRENZY OVERLOOK THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS CRIME COMING TO LIGHT
2090-147030-0013 HE HAD REACHED THE BOTTOM OF EDGWARE ROAD AND WAS TURNING THE CORNER OF THE STREET LOOKING ACROSS TO THE MARBLE ARCH
2090-147030-0014 I WAS JUST COMING TO SEE YOU HE SAID I THOUGHT YOUR INTERVIEW WITH THE YOUNG LADY WOULD BE LONGER JUST WAIT A MOMENT TILL I'VE PAID THE CABMAN BY THE WAY I SAW YOUR CHINK SERVANT AND GATHER YOU SENT HIM TO THE YARD ON A SPOOF ERRAND
2090-147030-0015 WHEN HE RETURNED HE MET TARLING'S EYE AND GRINNED SYMPATHETICALLY I KNOW WHAT'S IN YOUR MIND HE SAID FRANKLY BUT REALLY THE CHIEF THINKS IT NO MORE THAN AN EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCE
2090-147030-0016 TARLING NODDED AND CAN YOU DISCOVER HOW IT CAME TO BE IN THE POSSESSION OF HE PAUSED THE MURDERER OF THORNTON LYNE
2090-147030-0017 IN FACT IT'S HARDLY SO MUCH A THEORY AS AN HYPOTHESIS WHITESIDE GRINNED AGAIN
2090-147030-0018 THE PRESS CUTTINGS DESCRIPTIVE OF THE LATE MISTER LYNE'S CONDUCT IN SHANGHAI
2090-147030-0019 I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOUR LING CHU HE'S A PRETTY GOOD POLICEMAN ISN'T HE THE BEST IN CHINA SAID TARLING PROMPTLY BUT I'M NOT GOING TO PRETEND THAT I UNDERSTAND HIS MIND THESE ARE THE FACTS THE REVOLVER OR RATHER THE PISTOL WAS IN MY CUPBOARD
2090-147030-0020 AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD GET AT IT WAS LING CHU THERE IS THE SECOND AND MORE IMPORTANT FACT IMPUTING MOTIVE THAT LING CHU HAD EVERY REASON TO HATE THORNTON LYNE THE MAN WHO HAD INDIRECTLY BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SISTER'S DEATH
2090-147030-0021 AND I NOW RECALL THAT LING CHU WAS UNUSUALLY SILENT AFTER HE HAD SEEN LYNE HE HAS ADMITTED TO ME THAT HE HAS BEEN TO LYNE'S STORE
2090-147030-0022 WE HAPPENED TO BE DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF MISS RIDER COMMITTING THE MURDER AND LING CHU TOLD ME THAT MISS RIDER COULD NOT DRIVE A MOTOR CAR AND WHEN I QUESTIONED HIM AS TO HOW HE KNEW THIS HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD MADE SEVERAL INQUIRIES AT THE STORE THIS I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT
2090-147030-0023 HERE IS ANOTHER CURIOUS FACT TARLING WENT ON I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT LING CHU DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH
2090-147030-0024 I'LL PUT A COUPLE OF MEN ON TO WATCH HIM SAID WHITESIDE
2090-147030-0025 I TELL YOU HE IS A BETTER SLEUTH THAN ANY YOU HAVE GOT AT SCOTLAND YARD
2090-147030-0026 LEAVE LING CHU TO ME I KNOW THE WAY TO DEAL WITH HIM HE ADDED GRIMLY THE LITTLE DAFFODIL SAID WHITESIDE THOUGHTFULLY REPEATING THE PHRASE WHICH TARLING HAD QUOTED
2090-147030-0027 BY JOVE IT'S SOMETHING MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE DON'T YOU THINK TARLING
2090-147030-0028 THERE IS NO SUCH WORD AS DAFFODIL IN CHINESE IN FACT I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT THE DAFFODIL IS A NATIVE OF CHINA AT ALL THOUGH CHINA'S A MIGHTY BIG PLACE STRICTLY SPEAKING THE GIRL WAS CALLED THE LITTLE NARCISSUS
2090-147030-0029 IS MURDERED WHILST HER BROTHER IS IN LONDON THEY HAD CROSSED THE BROAD ROADWAY AS THEY WERE SPEAKING AND HAD PASSED INTO HYDE PARK TARLING THOUGHT WHIMSICALLY THAT THIS OPEN SPACE EXERCISED THE SAME ATTRACTION ON HIM AS IT DID UPON MISTER MILBURGH
2090-147030-0030 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SEE ME ABOUT HE ASKED SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT WHITESIDE HAD BEEN ON HIS WAY TO THE HOTEL WHEN THEY HAD MET I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE LAST REPORT ABOUT MILBURGH MILBURGH AGAIN
2090-147030-0031 BUT WHAT WHITESIDE HAD TO TELL WAS NOT ESPECIALLY THRILLING MILBURGH HAD BEEN SHADOWED DAY AND NIGHT AND THE RECORD OF HIS DOINGS WAS A VERY PROSAIC ONE BUT IT IS OUT OF PROSAIC HAPPENINGS THAT BIG CLUES ARE BORN
2090-147030-0032 WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT ASKED TARLING WELL REPLIED WHITESIDE HE HAS BEEN BUYING LEDGERS AND TARLING LAUGHED THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A VERY OFFENSIVE PROCEEDING HE SAID GOOD HUMOUREDLY
2090-147030-0033 WHAT SORT OF LEDGERS THOSE HEAVY THINGS WHICH ARE USED IN BIG OFFICES YOU KNOW THE SORT OF THING THAT IT TAKES ONE MAN ALL HIS TIME TO LIFT HE BOUGHT THREE AT ROEBUCK'S IN CITY ROAD AND TOOK THEM TO HIS HOUSE BY TAXI
2090-147030-0034 NOW MY THEORY SAID WHITESIDE EARNESTLY IS THAT THIS FELLOW IS NO ORDINARY CRIMINAL IF HE IS A CRIMINAL AT ALL IT MAY BE THAT HE HAS BEEN KEEPING A DUPLICATE SET OF BOOKS
2090-147030-0035 AND IT IS MORE THAN POSSIBLE THAT YOUR FIRST THEORY WAS RIGHT NAMELY THAT HE CONTEMPLATES EITHER GOING WITH ANOTHER FIRM OR STARTING A NEW BUSINESS OF HIS OWN THE SECOND SUPPOSITION IS MORE LIKELY ANYWAY IT IS NO CRIME TO OWN A LEDGER OR EVEN THREE
2090-147030-0036 BY THE WAY WHEN DID HE BUY THESE BOOKS YESTERDAY SAID WHITESIDE EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE LYNE'S OPENED HOW DID YOUR INTERVIEW WITH MISS RIDER GO OFF TARLING SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
2090-147030-0037 AND REALISED JUST HOW BIG A FOOL HE WAS IN ALLOWING HER SWEETNESS TO DRUG HIM
2090-147030-0038 TARLING NODDED WHO
2090-147030-0039 AND DREW FORTH THE TWO CARDS BEARING THE FINGER IMPRESSIONS HE HAD TAKEN OF ODETTE RIDER IT REQUIRED MORE THAN AN ORDINARY EFFORT OF WILL TO DO THIS
2090-147030-0040 HERE ARE THE IMPRESSIONS YOU WANTED HE SAID WILL YOU TAKE THEM WHITESIDE TOOK THE CARDS WITH A NOD AND EXAMINED THE INKY SMUDGES AND ALL THE TIME TARLING'S HEART STOOD STILL
2090-147030-0041 FOR INSPECTOR WHITESIDE WAS THE RECOGNISED AUTHORITY OF THE POLICE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT ON FINGER PRINTS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS THE SURVEY WAS A LONG ONE TARLING REMEMBERED THE SCENE FOR YEARS AFTERWARDS THE SUNLIT PATH
2090-147030-0042 THE STRAGGLING IDLERS THE CARRIAGES PURSUING THEIR LEISURELY WAY ALONG THE WALKS
2090-147030-0043 WHICH IS RATHER EXTRAORDINARY VERY INTERESTING WELL ASKED TARLING IMPATIENTLY ALMOST SAVAGELY INTERESTING
