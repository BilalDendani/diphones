4495-10160-0004 THE NOMINAL MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE FONDLY BELIEVED THAT THEIR CHIEF TROUBLES WERE OVER INNOCENT AND FATAL DELUSION IT IS ONE THING IN PRIVATE SOCIETY TO SET UP THE STAGE AND CHOOSE THE PLAY
4495-10160-0005 IT IS ANOTHER THING ALTOGETHER TO FIND THE ACTORS HITHERTO ONLY THE SMALL PRELIMINARY ANNOYANCES PROPER TO THE OCCASION HAD SHOWN THEMSELVES AT EVERGREEN LODGE THE SOUND AND SERIOUS TROUBLES WERE ALL TO COME

4495-10160-0026 WITH A PERFECT EXPLOSION OF THANKS FATHER MOTHER AND DAUGHTER SOWING THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE BROADCAST FROM THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR TO THE GARDEN GATES AS SOON AS THE CARRIAGE HAD DRIVEN AWAY
4495-10160-0027 MAGDALEN PRESENTED HERSELF TO THE GENERAL OBSERVATION UNDER AN ENTIRELY NEW ASPECT IF ANY MORE VISITORS CALL TO DAY SHE SAID WITH THE PROFOUNDEST GRAVITY OF LOOK AND MANNER

4495-10160-0031 AND THE QUIETER THE HOUSE IS THE MORE OBLIGED I SHALL FEEL TO EVERYBODY BEFORE MISS GARTH'S BATTERY OF REPROOF COULD OPEN FIRE BEFORE THE FIRST OUTBURST OF MISTER VANSTONE'S HEARTY LAUGHTER COULD ESCAPE HIS LIPS
4495-10160-0032 SHE BOWED TO THEM WITH IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY ASCENDED THE HOUSE STEPS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE AT A WALK INSTEAD OF A RUN AND RETIRED THEN AND THERE TO THE BEDROOM REGIONS
4495-10160-0033 FRANK'S HELPLESS ASTONISHMENT AT HER DISAPPEARANCE ADDED A NEW ELEMENT OF ABSURDITY TO THE SCENE HE STOOD FIRST ON ONE LEG AND THEN ON THE OTHER
4495-10160-0034 ROLLING AND UNROLLING HIS PART AND LOOKING PITEOUSLY IN THE FACES OF THE FRIENDS ABOUT HIM I KNOW I CAN'T DO IT HE SAID MAY I COME IN AFTER TEA AND HEAR MAGDALEN'S VIEWS THANK YOU
4495-10160-0035 DON'T TELL MY FATHER ABOUT THIS ACTING PLEASE I SHOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT THOSE WERE THE ONLY WORDS HE HAD SPIRIT ENOUGH TO UTTER HE DRIFTED AWAY AIMLESSLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SHRUBBERY
4495-10160-0036 WITH THE PART HANGING OPEN IN HIS HAND THE MOST INCAPABLE OF FALKLANDS AND THE MOST HELPLESS OF MANKIND FRANK'S DEPARTURE LEFT THE FAMILY BY THEMSELVES
4495-10160-0037 AND WAS THE SIGNAL ACCORDINGLY FOR AN ATTACK ON MISTER VANSTONE'S INVETERATE CARELESSNESS IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS PATERNAL AUTHORITY
4495-10160-0038 WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE THINKING OF ANDREW WHEN YOU GAVE YOUR CONSENT
4495-10160-0039 SURELY MY SILENCE WAS A SUFFICIENT WARNING TO YOU TO SAY NO A MISTAKE MISTER VANSTONE CHIMED IN MISS GARTH MADE WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS BUT A MISTAKE FOR ALL THAT
4495-10160-0040 IT MAY BE A MISTAKE SAID NORAH TAKING HER FATHER'S PART AS USUAL BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW PAPA OR ANY ONE ELSE COULD HAVE DECLINED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
4495-10160-0041 QUITE RIGHT MY DEAR OBSERVED MISTER VANSTONE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS YOU SAY WERE DEAD AGAINST ME HERE WERE THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN A SCRAPE ON ONE SIDE AND MAGDALEN ON THE OTHER MAD TO ACT
4495-10160-0042 I COULDN'T SAY I HAD METHODISTICAL OBJECTIONS I'VE NOTHING METHODISTICAL ABOUT ME WHAT OTHER EXCUSE COULD I MAKE THE MARRABLES ARE RESPECTABLE PEOPLE AND KEEP THE BEST COMPANY IN CLIFTON
4495-10160-0043 WHAT HARM CAN SHE GET IN THEIR HOUSE IF YOU COME TO PRUDENCE AND THAT SORT OF THING WHY SHOULDN'T MAGDALEN DO WHAT MISS MARRABLE DOES THERE THERE LET THE POOR THINGS ACT AND AMUSE THEMSELVES
4495-10160-0044 WHAT IS YOUR HEAD RUNNING ON NOW THOUGHT MISS GARTH CASTING A SHARP LOOK AT NORAH'S DARK DOWNCAST FACE YOU'RE ONE OF THE IMPENETRABLE SORT GIVE ME MAGDALEN WITH ALL HER PERVERSITIES I CAN SEE DAYLIGHT THROUGH HER
4495-10160-0045 AND EVERYWHERE FROM THE GARRET TO THE KITCHEN THE HOUSE SEEMED HARDLY LIKE ITSELF WITH THE ONE EVER DISTURBING ELEMENT IN THE FAMILY SERENITY SUDDENLY WITHDRAWN FROM IT
4495-10160-0046 AND COMFORTABLY ARRAYED IN HER MORNING WRAPPER UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO DRESS FOR DINNER AND THERE BEHIND HER SAT THE LADY'S MAID SLOWLY COMBING OUT THE LONG HEAVY LOCKS OF HER YOUNG MISTRESS'S HAIR
4495-10160-0047 WITH THE SLEEPY RESIGNATION OF A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THAT EMPLOYMENT FOR SOME HOURS PAST THE SUN WAS SHINING AND THE GREEN SHUTTERS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WERE CLOSED THE DIM LIGHT FELL TENDERLY ON THE TWO QUIET SEATED FIGURES
4495-10160-0048 WHICH LOOPED UP ITS CURTAINS AND THE BRIGHT DRESS FOR DINNER LAID READY ACROSS IT ON THE GAYLY PAINTED BATH WITH ITS PURE LINING OF WHITE ENAMEL ON THE TOILET TABLE WITH ITS SPARKLING TRINKETS ITS CRYSTAL BOTTLES
4495-10160-0049 THE COOL FRAGRANCE OF FLOWERS AND PERFUMES IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE RAPT ATTITUDE OF MAGDALEN ABSORBED OVER HER READING THE MONOTONOUS REGULARITY OF MOVEMENT IN THE MAID'S HAND AND ARM AS SHE DREW THE COMB SMOOTHLY
4495-10160-0050 THROUGH AND THROUGH HER MISTRESS'S HAIR ALL CONVEYED THE SAME SOOTHING IMPRESSION OF DROWSY DELICIOUS QUIET ON ONE SIDE OF THE DOOR WERE THE BROAD DAYLIGHT AND THE FAMILIAR REALITIES OF LIFE
4495-10160-0051 THE SANCTUARY OF UNRUFFLED REPOSE MISS GARTH PAUSED ON THE THRESHOLD AND LOOKED INTO THE ROOM IN SILENCE MAGDALEN'S CURIOUS FANCY FOR HAVING HER HAIR COMBED AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS
4495-10160-0052 WAS AMONG THE PECULIARITIES OF HER CHARACTER WHICH WERE NOTORIOUS TO EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE IT WAS ONE OF HER FATHER'S FAVORITE JOKES THAT SHE REMINDED HIM ON SUCH OCCASIONS OF A CAT HAVING HER BACK STROKED
4495-10160-0053 THE GIRL'S FERVID TEMPERAMENT INTENSIFIED THE ESSENTIALLY FEMININE PLEASURE THAT MOST WOMEN FEEL IN THE PASSAGE OF THE COMB THROUGH THEIR HAIR TO A LUXURY OF SENSATION WHICH ABSORBED HER IN ENJOYMENT
4495-10160-0054 SO SERENELY SELF DEMONSTRATIVE SO DROWSILY DEEP THAT IT DID IRRESISTIBLY SUGGEST A PET CAT'S ENJOYMENT UNDER A CARESSING HAND
4495-10160-0055 INTIMATELY AS MISS GARTH WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THIS PECULIARITY IN HER PUPIL SHE NOW SAW IT ASSERTING ITSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ASSOCIATION WITH MENTAL EXERTION OF ANY KIND ON MAGDALEN'S PART
4495-10160-0056 SHE VENTURED ON PUTTING THE QUESTION FIRST TO THE MISTRESS AND RECEIVING NO ANSWER IN THAT QUARTER SECONDLY TO THE MAID ALL THE AFTERNOON MISS OFF AND ON WAS THE WEARY ANSWER
4495-10160-0057 MISS MAGDALEN SAYS IT SOOTHES HER FEELINGS AND CLEARS HER MIND KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE THAT INTERFERENCE WOULD BE HOPELESS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MISS GARTH TURNED SHARPLY AND LEFT THE ROOM
4495-10160-0058 SHE SMILED WHEN SHE WAS OUTSIDE ON THE LANDING THE FEMALE MIND DOES OCCASIONALLY THOUGH NOT OFTEN PROJECT ITSELF INTO THE FUTURE MISS GARTH WAS PROPHETICALLY PITYING MAGDALEN'S UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND
4495-10160-0059 DINNER TIME PRESENTED THE FAIR STUDENT TO THE FAMILY EYE IN THE SAME MENTALLY ABSORBED ASPECT ON ALL ORDINARY OCCASIONS MAGDALEN'S APPETITE WOULD HAVE TERRIFIED THOSE FEEBLE SENTIMENTALISTS
4495-10160-0060 WHO AFFECT TO IGNORE THE ALL IMPORTANT INFLUENCE WHICH FEMALE FEEDING EXERTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF FEMALE BEAUTY ON THIS OCCASION SHE REFUSED ONE DISH AFTER ANOTHER WITH A RESOLUTION WHICH IMPLIED THE RAREST OF ALL MODERN MARTYRDOMS
4495-10160-0061 GASTRIC MARTYRDOM I HAVE CONCEIVED THE PART OF LUCY SHE OBSERVED WITH THE DEMUREST GRAVITY THE NEXT DIFFICULTY IS TO MAKE FRANK CONCEIVE THE PART OF FALKLAND I SEE NOTHING TO LAUGH AT YOU WOULD
4495-10160-0062 ALL BE SERIOUS ENOUGH IF YOU HAD MY RESPONSIBILITIES NO PAPA NO WINE TO DAY THANK YOU I MUST KEEP MY INTELLIGENCE CLEAR WATER THOMAS AND A LITTLE MORE JELLY I THINK BEFORE YOU TAKE IT AWAY
4495-10160-0063 WHEN FRANK PRESENTED HIMSELF IN THE EVENING IGNORANT OF THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF HIS PART SHE TOOK HIM IN HAND AS A MIDDLE AGED SCHOOLMISTRESS MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IN HAND A BACKWARD LITTLE BOY
4495-10160-0064 THE FEW ATTEMPTS HE MADE TO VARY THE STERNLY PRACTICAL NATURE OF THE EVENING'S OCCUPATION BY SLIPPING IN COMPLIMENTS SIDELONG
4495-10160-0065 OF A WOMAN OF TWICE HER AGE SHE LITERALLY FORCED HIM INTO HIS PART HER FATHER FELL ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR MISSUS VANSTONE AND MISS GARTH LOST THEIR INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS
4495-10160-0066 RETIRED TO THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM AND SPOKE TOGETHER IN WHISPERS IT GREW LATER AND LATER AND STILL MAGDALEN NEVER FLINCHED FROM HER TASK STILL WITH EQUAL PERSEVERANCE NORAH WHO HAD BEEN ON THE WATCH ALL THROUGH THE EVENING
4495-10160-0067 KEPT ON THE WATCH TO THE END THE DISTRUST DARKENED AND DARKENED ON HER FACE AS SHE LOOKED AT HER SISTER AND FRANK
4495-10160-0068 TAKING LEAVE OF MISTER VANSTONE AT THE HALL DOOR I'M TO COME TO MORROW AND HEAR MORE OF HER VIEWS IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION I SHALL NEVER DO IT DON'T TELL HER I SAID SO
4495-10160-0069 AS FAST AS SHE TEACHES ME ONE SPEECH
4495-10160-0070 DISCOURAGING ISN'T IT GOODNIGHT
4495-10160-0071 ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING MISSUS VANSTONE'S SPIRITS HAD BEEN SADLY DEPRESSED AT A PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH MISS GARTH SHE HAD REFERRED AGAIN OF HER OWN ACCORD TO THE SUBJECT OF HER LETTER FROM LONDON
4495-10160-0072 HAD SPOKEN SELF REPROACHFULLY OF HER WEAKNESS IN ADMITTING CAPTAIN WRAGGE'S IMPUDENT CLAIM TO A FAMILY CONNECTION WITH HER AND HAD THEN REVERTED TO THE STATE OF HER HEALTH
4495-10160-0073 AND TO THE DOUBTFUL PROSPECT THAT AWAITED HER IN THE COMING SUMMER IN A TONE OF DESPONDENCY WHICH IT WAS VERY DISTRESSING TO HEAR ANXIOUS TO CHEER HER SPIRITS MISS GARTH HAD CHANGED THE CONVERSATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
4495-10160-0074 HAD REFERRED TO THE APPROACHING THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE AND HAD RELIEVED MISSUS VANSTONE'S MIND OF ALL ANXIETY IN THAT DIRECTION BY ANNOUNCING HER INTENTION OF ACCOMPANYING MAGDALEN TO EACH REHEARSAL
4495-10160-0075 ACCORDINGLY WHEN FRANK PRESENTED HIMSELF AT COMBE RAVEN ON THE EVENTFUL MORNING THERE STOOD MISS GARTH PREPARED IN THE INTERPOLATED CHARACTER OF ARGUS TO ACCOMPANY LUCY AND FALKLAND TO THE SCENE OF TRIAL
4495-10160-0076 THE RAILWAY CONVEYED THE THREE IN EXCELLENT TIME TO EVERGREEN LODGE
