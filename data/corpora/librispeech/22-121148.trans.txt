22-121148-0000 LA CRAMPADE FEBRUARY MY DEAR LOUISE I WAS BOUND TO WAIT SOME TIME BEFORE WRITING TO YOU BUT NOW I KNOW OR RATHER I HAVE LEARNED MANY THINGS WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FUTURE HAPPINESS I MUST TELL YOU
22-121148-0001 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GIRL AND A MARRIED WOMAN IS SO VAST THAT THE GIRL CAN NO MORE COMPREHEND IT THAN THE MARRIED WOMAN CAN GO BACK TO GIRLHOOD AGAIN
22-121148-0002 RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT THAT AT LEAST IS PLAIN SO SOON AS I REALIZED THAT THE CONVENT WAS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO MARRYING LOUIS I HAD AS GIRLS SAY TO SUBMIT
22-121148-0003 AND TRY TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT THE SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT I WAS UNDERTAKING FILLED ME AT FIRST WITH TERROR MARRIAGE IS A MATTER CONCERNING THE WHOLE OF LIFE WHILST LOVE AIMS ONLY AT PLEASURE
22-121148-0004 ON THE OTHER HAND MARRIAGE WILL REMAIN WHEN PLEASURES HAVE VANISHED AND IT IS THE SOURCE OF INTERESTS FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN THOSE OF THE MAN AND WOMAN ENTERING ON THE ALLIANCE MIGHT IT NOT THEREFORE BE THAT THE ONLY REQUISITE FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE WAS FRIENDSHIP
22-121148-0005 A FRIENDSHIP WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF THESE ADVANTAGES WOULD SHUT ITS EYES TO MANY OF THE IMPERFECTIONS OF HUMANITY NOW THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXISTENCE OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MYSELF AND LOUIS DE L'ESTORADE
22-121148-0006 HAVING RENOUNCED ALL IDEA OF FINDING IN MARRIAGE THOSE TRANSPORTS OF LOVE ON WHICH OUR MINDS USED SO OFTEN AND WITH SUCH PERILOUS RAPTURE TO DWELL I FOUND A GENTLE CALM SETTLING OVER ME IF DEBARRED FROM LOVE
22-121148-0007 WHY NOT SEEK FOR HAPPINESS I SAID TO MYSELF MOREOVER I AM LOVED AND THE LOVE OFFERED ME I SHALL ACCEPT MY MARRIED LIFE WILL BE NO SLAVERY BUT RATHER A PERPETUAL REIGN
22-121148-0008 THE IMPORTANT POINT OF SEPARATING MARRIAGE FROM MARITAL RIGHTS WAS SETTLED IN A CONVERSATION BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE GAVE PROOF OF AN EXCELLENT TEMPER AND A TENDER HEART
22-121148-0009 RETAINING PERFECT INDEPENDENCE WHAT COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE MORE HONORABLE A CONTRACT OF THIS KIND DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE LEGAL CONTRACT AND EVEN TO THE SACRAMENT ITSELF COULD BE CONCLUDED ONLY BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
22-121148-0010 THIS DIFFICULTY THE FIRST WHICH HAS ARISEN IS THE ONLY ONE WHICH HAS DELAYED THE COMPLETION OF OUR MARRIAGE ALTHOUGH AT FIRST I MAY HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT ANYTHING RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT IT IS ONLY IN HUMAN NATURE
22-121148-0011 HAVING GOT AN INCH TO ASK FOR AN ELL AND YOU AND I SWEET LOVE ARE OF THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE IT ALL I WATCHED LOUIS OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE AND PUT IT TO MYSELF HAS SUFFERING HAD A SOFTENING OR A HARDENING EFFECT ON HIM
22-121148-0012 BY DINT OF CLOSE STUDY I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS LOVE AMOUNTED TO A PASSION ONCE TRANSFORMED INTO AN IDOL WHOSE SLIGHTEST FROWN WOULD TURN HIM WHITE AND TREMBLING I REALIZED THAT I MIGHT VENTURE ANYTHING
22-121148-0013 I DREW HIM ASIDE IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER ON SOLITARY WALKS DURING WHICH I DISCREETLY SOUNDED HIS FEELINGS I MADE HIM TALK AND GOT HIM TO EXPOUND TO ME HIS IDEAS AND PLANS FOR OUR FUTURE MY QUESTIONS BETRAYED SO MANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
22-121148-0014 THAT LOUIS HAS SINCE CONFESSED TO ME THE ALARM IT CAUSED HIM TO FIND IN ME SO LITTLE OF THE IGNORANT MAIDEN THEN I LISTENED TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN REPLY HE GOT MIXED UP IN HIS ARGUMENTS AS PEOPLE DO WHEN HANDICAPPED BY FEAR
22-121148-0015 AND BEFORE LONG IT BECAME CLEAR THAT CHANCE HAD GIVEN ME FOR ADVERSARY ONE WHO WAS THE LESS FITTED FOR THE CONTEST BECAUSE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU MAGNILOQUENTLY CALL MY GREATNESS OF SOUL BROKEN BY SUFFERINGS AND MISFORTUNE
22-121148-0016 IN THE NEXT PLACE HE SHARES OUR VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF MY BEAUTY AND IT IS CRUEL FOR HIM TO SEE HOW THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS LIFE HAVE ROBBED HIM OF YOUTH FINALLY HE FELT THE SUPERIORITY OF MY WOMANHOOD OVER HIS MANHOOD
22-121148-0017 THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESE THREE OBVIOUS DRAWBACKS MADE HIM DISTRUSTFUL OF HIMSELF HE DOUBTED HIS POWER TO MAKE ME HAPPY AND GUESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS
22-121148-0018 ONE EVENING HE TENTATIVELY SUGGESTED THAT I ONLY MARRIED HIM TO ESCAPE THE CONVENT I CANNOT DENY IT WAS MY GRAVE REPLY MY DEAR IT TOUCHED ME TO THE HEART TO SEE THE TWO GREAT TEARS WHICH STOOD IN HIS EYES
22-121148-0019 THE FAVOR I AM ABOUT TO ASK FROM YOU WILL DEMAND UNSELFISHNESS ON YOUR PART FAR NOBLER THAN THE SERVITUDE TO WHICH A MAN'S LOVE WHEN SINCERE IS SUPPOSED TO REDUCE HIM THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU RISE TO THE HEIGHT OF FRIENDSHIP SUCH AS I UNDERSTAND IT
22-121148-0020 LIFE GIVES US BUT ONE FRIEND AND I WISH TO BE YOURS FRIENDSHIP IS THE BOND BETWEEN A PAIR OF KINDRED SOULS UNITED IN THEIR STRENGTH AND YET INDEPENDENT LET US BE FRIENDS AND COMRADES TO BEAR JOINTLY THE BURDEN OF LIFE
22-121148-0021 LEAVE ME ABSOLUTELY FREE I WOULD PUT NO HINDRANCE IN THE WAY OF YOUR INSPIRING ME WITH A LOVE SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN BUT I AM DETERMINED TO BE YOURS ONLY OF MY OWN FREE GIFT CREATE IN ME THE WISH TO GIVE UP MY FREEDOM
22-121148-0022 INFUSE WITH PASSION THEN IF YOU WILL THIS FRIENDSHIP AND LET THE VOICE OF LOVE DISTURB ITS CALM ON MY PART I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO BRING MY FEELINGS INTO ACCORD WITH YOURS ONE THING ABOVE ALL I WOULD BEG OF YOU
22-121148-0023 SPARE ME THE ANNOYANCES TO WHICH THE STRANGENESS OF OUR MUTUAL POSITION MIGHT GIVE RISE TO OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHERS I AM NEITHER WHIMSICAL NOR PRUDISH AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO GET THAT REPUTATION
22-121148-0024 DO NOT FANCY I CONCLUDED THAT I ASK THIS FROM ANY WISH TO BE ECCENTRIC IT IS THE GREAT DESIRE I HAVE FOR YOUR RESPECT WHICH PROMPTS MY REQUEST IF YOU OWE THE CROWN OF YOUR LOVE MERELY TO THE LEGAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY
22-121148-0025 WHAT GRATITUDE COULD YOU FEEL TO ME LATER FOR A GIFT IN WHICH MY GOODWILL COUNTED FOR NOTHING IF DURING THE TIME THAT I REMAINED INDIFFERENT TO YOU YIELDING ONLY A PASSIVE OBEDIENCE SUCH AS MY MOTHER HAS JUST BEEN URGING ON ME A CHILD WERE BORN TO US
22-121148-0026 IN A COUNTRY LIFE SUCH AS OURS WILL BE OUGHT WE NOT TO BEAR IN MIND THE EVANESCENT NATURE OF PASSION IS IT NOT SIMPLE PRUDENCE TO MAKE PROVISION BEFOREHAND AGAINST THE CALAMITIES INCIDENT TO CHANGE OF FEELING
22-121148-0027 HE WAS GREATLY ASTONISHED TO FIND ME AT ONCE SO REASONABLE AND SO APT AT REASONING BUT HE MADE ME A SOLEMN PROMISE AFTER WHICH I TOOK HIS HAND AND PRESSED IT AFFECTIONATELY WE WERE MARRIED AT THE END OF THE WEEK
22-121148-0028 SECURE OF MY FREEDOM I WAS ABLE TO THROW MYSELF GAILY INTO THE PETTY DETAILS WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANY A CEREMONY OF THE KIND AND TO BE MY NATURAL SELF PERHAPS I MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR AN OLD BIRD AS THEY SAY AT BLOIS
22-121148-0029 DEAR THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH WOULD BESET MY LIFE HAD APPEARED TO ME CLEARLY AS IN A VISION AND I WAS SINCERELY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF THE MAN I MARRIED NOW IN THE SOLITUDE OF A LIFE LIKE OURS
22-121148-0030 MARRIAGE SOON BECOMES INTOLERABLE UNLESS THE WOMAN IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT A WOMAN IN SUCH A CASE NEEDS THE CHARM OF A MISTRESS COMBINED WITH THE SOLID QUALITIES OF A WIFE
22-121148-0031 AND INVEST HER WITH AN EXHAUSTLESS POWER A REDUNDANCY OF LIFE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING BLOSSOM AROUND HER THE MORE SHE IS MISTRESS OF HERSELF THE MORE CERTAINLY WILL THE LOVE AND HAPPINESS SHE CREATES BE FIT TO WEATHER THE STORMS OF LIFE
22-121148-0032 BUT ABOVE ALL I HAVE INSISTED ON THE GREATEST SECRECY IN REGARD TO OUR DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS A HUSBAND WHO SUBMITS TO HIS WIFE'S YOKE IS JUSTLY HELD AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE A WOMAN'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE ENTIRELY CONCEALED
22-121148-0033 IN THIS TASK TOWARDS WHICH MY EVERY ENERGY SHALL BE BENT WHILE IT REMAINS CONCEALED FROM ALL BUT GOD AND YOU I AM VERY NEARLY HAPPY NOW BUT SHOULD I BE SO WITHOUT A FRIENDLY HEART IN WHICH TO POUR THE CONFESSION FOR HOW MAKE A CONFIDANT OF HIM
22-121148-0034 MY HAPPINESS WOULD WOUND HIM AND HAS TO BE CONCEALED HE IS SENSITIVE AS A WOMAN LIKE ALL MEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH FOR THREE MONTHS WE REMAINED AS WE WERE BEFORE MARRIAGE AS YOU MAY IMAGINE
22-121148-0035 DURING THIS TIME I MADE A CLOSE STUDY OF MANY SMALL PERSONAL MATTERS WHICH HAVE MORE TO DO WITH LOVE THAN IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED IN SPITE OF MY COLDNESS LOUIS GREW BOLDER AND HIS NATURE EXPANDED I SAW ON HIS FACE A NEW EXPRESSION
22-121148-0036 A LOOK OF YOUTH THE GREATER REFINEMENT WHICH I INTRODUCED INTO THE HOUSE WAS REFLECTED IN HIS PERSON INSENSIBLY I BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO HIS PRESENCE AND MADE ANOTHER SELF OF HIM
22-121148-0037 BY DINT OF CONSTANT WATCHING I DISCOVERED HOW HIS MIND AND COUNTENANCE HARMONIZE THE ANIMAL THAT WE CALL A HUSBAND TO QUOTE YOUR WORDS DISAPPEARED AND ONE BALMY EVENING I DISCOVERED IN HIS STEAD A LOVER
22-121148-0038 WHOSE WORDS THRILLED ME AND ON WHOSE ARM I LEANT WITH PLEASURE BEYOND WORDS IN SHORT TO BE OPEN WITH YOU AS I WOULD BE WITH GOD BEFORE WHOM CONCEALMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE THE PERFECT LOYALTY WITH WHICH HE HAD KEPT HIS OATH MAY HAVE PIQUED ME
22-121148-0039 BITTERLY ASHAMED I STRUGGLED WITH MYSELF ALAS WHEN PRIDE IS THE ONLY MOTIVE FOR RESISTANCE EXCUSES FOR CAPITULATION ARE SOON FOUND WE CELEBRATED OUR UNION IN SECRET AND SECRET IT MUST REMAIN BETWEEN US
22-121148-0040 WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED YOU WILL APPROVE THIS RESERVE ENOUGH THAT NOTHING WAS LACKING EITHER OF SATISFACTION FOR THE MOST FASTIDIOUS SENTIMENT OR OF THAT UNEXPECTEDNESS WHICH BRINGS IN A SENSE ITS OWN SANCTION
22-121148-0041 EVERY WITCHERY OF IMAGINATION OF PASSION OF RELUCTANCE OVERCOME OF THE IDEAL PASSING INTO REALITY PLAYED ITS PART YET IN SPITE OF ALL THIS ENCHANTMENT I ONCE MORE STOOD OUT FOR MY COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE
22-121148-0042 I CAN'T TELL YOU ALL MY REASONS FOR THIS TO YOU ALONE SHALL I CONFIDE EVEN AS MUCH AS THIS I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN WHETHER PASSIONATELY LOVED OR NOT LOSE MUCH IN THEIR RELATION WITH THEIR HUSBANDS BY NOT CONCEALING THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT MARRIAGE AND THE WAY THEY LOOK AT IT
22-121148-0043 MY ONE JOY AND IT IS SUPREME SPRINGS FROM THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING BROUGHT NEW LIFE TO MY HUSBAND BEFORE I HAVE BORNE HIM ANY CHILDREN LOUIS HAS REGAINED HIS YOUTH STRENGTH AND SPIRITS HE IS NOT THE SAME MAN
22-121148-0044 WITH MAGIC TOUCH I HAVE EFFACED THE VERY MEMORY OF HIS SUFFERINGS IT IS A COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS LOUIS IS REALLY VERY ATTRACTIVE NOW FEELING SURE OF MY AFFECTION HE THROWS OFF HIS RESERVE AND DISPLAYS UNSUSPECTED GIFTS
22-121148-0045 TO BE THE UNCEASING SPRING OF HAPPINESS FOR A MAN WHO KNOWS IT AND ADDS GRATITUDE TO LOVE AH DEAR ONE THIS IS A CONVICTION WHICH FORTIFIES THE SOUL EVEN MORE THAN THE MOST PASSIONATE LOVE CAN DO
22-121148-0046 THE FORCE THUS DEVELOPED AT ONCE IMPETUOUS AND ENDURING SIMPLE AND DIVERSIFIED BRINGS FORTH ULTIMATELY THE FAMILY THAT NOBLE PRODUCT OF WOMANHOOD WHICH I REALIZE NOW IN ALL ITS ANIMATING BEAUTY
22-121148-0047 EVEN THE OLD MAN WOULD NOT BE A BLOT UPON MY PRETTY HOME AND HAS BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO LINE WITH ALL MY IMPROVEMENTS TO PLEASE ME HE HAS ADOPTED THE DRESS AND WITH THE DRESS THE MANNERS OF THE DAY WE HAVE ENGLISH HORSES
22-121148-0048 AND OBTAINING FOR IT THE MAXIMUM OF PLEASURE WITH THE MINIMUM OF COST I HAVE ALREADY CONVINCED LOUIS OF THE NECESSITY OF GETTING ROADS MADE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY EARN THE REPUTATION OF A MAN INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF HIS DISTRICT
22-121148-0049 I INSIST TOO ON HIS STUDYING A GREAT DEAL BEFORE LONG I HOPE TO SEE HIM A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF MY FAMILY AND HIS MOTHER'S I HAVE TOLD HIM PLAINLY THAT I AM AMBITIOUS
22-121148-0050 AND THAT I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED HIS FATHER SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOOK AFTER THE ESTATE AND PRACTISE ECONOMIES BECAUSE I WISHED HIM TO DEVOTE HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO POLITICS IF WE HAD CHILDREN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM ALL PROSPEROUS AND WITH GOOD STATE APPOINTMENTS
22-121148-0051 UNDER PENALTY THEREFORE OF FORFEITING MY ESTEEM AND AFFECTION HE MUST GET HIMSELF CHOSEN DEPUTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AT THE COMING ELECTIONS MY FAMILY WOULD SUPPORT HIS CANDIDATURE AND WE SHOULD THEN HAVE THE DELIGHT OF SPENDING ALL OUR WINTERS IN PARIS
22-121148-0052 AH MY LOVE BY THE ARDOR WITH WHICH HE EMBRACED MY PLANS I CAN GAUGE THE DEPTH OF HIS AFFECTION TO CONCLUDE HERE IS A LETTER HE WROTE ME YESTERDAY FROM MARSEILLES WHERE HE HAD GONE TO SPEND A FEW HOURS MY SWEET RENEE
22-121148-0053 WHEN I AM WITH YOU LOVE SO TRANSPORTS ME THAT I AM POWERLESS TO EXPRESS THE DEPTH OF MY AFFECTION I CAN BUT WORSHIP AND ADMIRE ONLY AT A DISTANCE DOES THE POWER OF SPEECH RETURN
22-121148-0054 YOU ARE SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL RENEE AND YOUR BEAUTY IS OF THE STATUESQUE AND REGAL TYPE ON WHICH TIME LEAVES BUT LITTLE IMPRESSION NO DOUBT THE LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DEPENDS LESS ON OUTWARD BEAUTY THAN ON GRACES OF CHARACTER
22-121148-0055 WHICH ARE YOURS ALSO IN PERFECTION STILL LET ME SAY THAT THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING YOUR UNCHANGING BEAUTY ON WHICH TO FEAST MY EYES GIVES ME A JOY THAT GROWS WITH EVERY GLANCE THERE IS A GRACE AND DIGNITY IN THE LINES OF YOUR FACE
22-121148-0056 YOUR FAVORS TO ME HOWEVER SLIGHT WILL ALWAYS MAKE MY HAPPINESS IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE AS NOW FOR I AM SENSIBLE HOW MUCH DIGNITY THERE IS IN OUR PROMISE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S LIBERTY
22-121148-0057 OUR OWN IMPULSE SHALL WITH US ALONE DICTATE THE EXPRESSION OF FEELING WE SHALL BE FREE EVEN IN OUR FETTERS I SHALL HAVE THE MORE PRIDE IN WOOING YOU AGAIN NOW THAT I KNOW THE REWARD YOU PLACE ON VICTORY YOU CANNOT SPEAK BREATHE
22-121148-0058 ACT OR THINK WITHOUT ADDING TO THE ADMIRATION I FEEL FOR YOUR CHARM BOTH OF BODY AND MIND THERE IS IN YOU A RARE COMBINATION OF THE IDEAL THE PRACTICAL AND THE BEWITCHING WHICH SATISFIES ALIKE JUDGMENT A HUSBAND'S PRIDE DESIRE AND HOPE
22-121148-0059 I LONG FOR THE DAY WHICH SHALL MAKE YOU A MOTHER THAT I MAY SEE YOU CONTENT WITH THE FULNESS OF YOUR LIFE MAY HEAR YOU IN THE SWEET VOICE I LOVE AND WITH THE THOUGHTS BLESS THE LOVE WHICH HAS REFRESHED MY SOUL AND GIVEN NEW VIGOR TO MY POWERS
22-121148-0060 THE LOVE WHICH IS MY PRIDE AND WHENCE I HAVE DRAWN AS FROM A MAGIC FOUNTAIN FRESH LIFE
22-121148-0061 I SHALL TAKE A LEADING PART IN THE PUBLIC LIFE OF THE DISTRICT AND ON YOU SHALL FALL THE RAYS OF A GLORY WHICH WILL OWE ITS EXISTENCE TO THE DESIRE OF PLEASING YOU SO MUCH FOR MY PUPIL DEAR DO YOU SUPPOSE HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN LIKE THIS BEFORE
22-121148-0062 A YEAR HENCE HIS STYLE WILL HAVE STILL FURTHER IMPROVED LOUIS IS NOW IN HIS FIRST TRANSPORT WHAT I LOOK FORWARD TO IS THE UNIFORM AND CONTINUOUS SENSATION OF CONTENT WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE FRUIT OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE
22-121148-0063 WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN IN PERFECT TRUST AND MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF GIVING VARIETY TO THE INFINITE THIS IS THE TASK SET BEFORE EVERY TRUE WIFE THE ANSWER BEGINS TO DAWN ON ME AND I SHALL NOT REST TILL I HAVE MADE IT MINE
22-121148-0064 YOU SEE THAT HE FANCIES HIMSELF VANITY OF MEN THE CHOSEN OF MY HEART JUST AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO LEGAL BONDS NEVERTHELESS I HAVE NOT YET GOT BEYOND THAT EXTERNAL ATTRACTION WHICH GIVES US STRENGTH TO PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL
22-121148-0065 YET LOUIS IS LOVABLE HIS TEMPER IS WONDERFULLY EVEN AND HE PERFORMS AS A MATTER OF COURSE ACTS ON WHICH MOST MEN WOULD PLUME THEMSELVES IN SHORT IF I DO NOT LOVE HIM I SHALL FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN BEING GOOD TO HIM
