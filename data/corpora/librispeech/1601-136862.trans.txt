1601-136862-0000 A CASUAL COINCIDENCE WITH OTHER WRITERS OR AN ADOPTION OF A SENTIMENT OR IMAGE WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE WRITINGS OF ANOTHER AND AFTERWARDS APPEARS IN THE MIND AS ONE'S OWN
1601-136862-0001 YOUR NOTES UPON MY POET WERE VERY ACCEPTABLE I BEG THAT YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO CONTINUE YOUR SEARCHES IT WILL BE REPUTABLE TO MY WORK AND SUITABLE TO YOUR PROFESSORSHIP TO HAVE SOMETHING OF YOURS IN THE NOTES AS YOU HAVE GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT YOUR NAME
1601-136862-0002 DEAR SIR YOU WILL RECEIVE THIS BY MISTER BARETTI A GENTLEMAN PARTICULARLY INTITLED TO THE NOTICE AND KINDNESS OF THE PROFESSOR OF POESY HE HAS TIME BUT FOR A SHORT STAY AND WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE IT FILLED UP WITH AS MUCH AS HE CAN HEAR AND SEE
1601-136862-0003 IN RECOMMENDING ANOTHER TO YOUR FAVOUR I OUGHT NOT TO OMIT THANKS FOR THE KINDNESS WHICH YOU HAVE SHEWN TO MYSELF HAVE YOU ANY MORE NOTES ON SHAKSPEARE I SHALL BE GLAD OF THEM
1601-136862-0004 DEAR SIR THOUGH I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM YOU UPON YOUR ENTRANCE INTO A NEW STATE OF LIFE AT A NEW PLACE YET RECOLLECTING NOT WITHOUT SOME DEGREE OF SHAME THAT I OWE YOU A LETTER UPON AN OLD ACCOUNT
1601-136862-0005 I SHOULD BE SORRY TO THINK THAT WHAT ENGROSSES THE ATTENTION OF MY FRIEND SHOULD HAVE NO PART OF MINE
1601-136862-0006 TO MITIGATE THE TERROURS OF A VIOLENT DEATH WHICH IS MORE FORMIDABLE AT THE FIRST GLANCE THAN ON A NEARER AND MORE STEADY VIEW A VIOLENT DEATH IS NEVER VERY PAINFUL THE ONLY DANGER IS LEST IT SHOULD BE UNPROVIDED
1601-136862-0007 BUT IF A MAN CAN BE SUPPOSED TO MAKE NO PROVISION FOR DEATH IN WAR WHAT CAN BE THE STATE THAT WOULD HAVE AWAKENED HIM TO THE CARE OF FUTURITY WHEN WOULD THAT MAN HAVE PREPARED HIMSELF TO DIE WHO WENT TO SEEK DEATH WITHOUT PREPARATION
1601-136862-0008 WHAT THEN CAN BE THE REASON WHY WE LAMENT MORE HIM THAT DIES OF A WOUND THAN HIM THAT DIES OF A FEVER A MAN THAT LANGUISHES WITH DISEASE ENDS HIS LIFE WITH MORE PAIN BUT WITH LESS VIRTUE
1601-136862-0009 HE LEAVES NO EXAMPLE TO HIS FRIENDS NOR BEQUEATHS ANY HONOUR TO HIS DESCENDANTS THE ONLY REASON WHY WE LAMENT A SOLDIER'S DEATH IS THAT WE THINK HE MIGHT HAVE LIVED LONGER
1601-136862-0010 YET THIS CAUSE OF GRIEF IS COMMON TO MANY OTHER KINDS OF DEATH WHICH ARE NOT SO PASSIONATELY BEWAILED THE TRUTH IS THAT EVERY DEATH IS VIOLENT WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF ACCIDENT EVERY DEATH WHICH IS NOT GRADUALLY BROUGHT ON BY THE MISERIES OF AGE
1601-136862-0011 OR WHEN LIFE IS EXTINGUISHED FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN THAT IT IS BURNT OUT HE THAT DIES BEFORE SIXTY OF A COLD OR CONSUMPTION DIES IN REALITY BY A VIOLENT DEATH
1601-136862-0012 YET HIS DEATH IS BORNE WITH PATIENCE ONLY BECAUSE THE CAUSE OF HIS UNTIMELY END IS SILENT AND INVISIBLE LET US ENDEAVOUR TO SEE THINGS AS THEY ARE AND THEN ENQUIRE WHETHER WE OUGHT TO COMPLAIN
1601-136862-0013 WHETHER TO SEE LIFE AS IT IS WILL GIVE US MUCH CONSOLATION I KNOW NOT BUT THE CONSOLATION WHICH IS DRAWN FROM TRUTH IF ANY THERE BE IS SOLID AND DURABLE THAT WHICH MAY BE DERIVED FROM ERROUR MUST BE LIKE ITS ORIGINAL
1601-136862-0014 I HAVE TO MENTION THAT THE LATE MISTER STRAHAN THE PRINTER TOLD ME THAT JOHNSON WROTE IT THAT WITH THE PROFITS HE MIGHT DEFRAY THE EXPENCE OF HIS MOTHER'S FUNERAL
1601-136862-0015 WRITTEN TO REFUTE THE SYSTEM OF OPTIMISM WHICH IT HAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH BRILLIANT SUCCESS IS WONDERFULLY SIMILAR IN ITS PLAN AND CONDUCT TO JOHNSON'S RASSELAS
1601-136862-0016 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN TO DENY THAT THE SCHEME OF THAT WHICH CAME LATEST WAS TAKEN FROM THE OTHER THOUGH THE PROPOSITION ILLUSTRATED BY BOTH THESE WORKS WAS THE SAME NAMELY THAT IN OUR PRESENT STATE THERE IS MORE EVIL THAN GOOD THE INTENTION OF THE WRITERS WAS VERY DIFFERENT
1601-136862-0017 OF DEPARTED SPIRITS A DOCTRINE WHICH IT IS A MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THAT HE HIMSELF EVER POSITIVELY HELD
1601-136862-0018 I WILL PROMISE YOU SAFETY THERE IS NO DANGER FROM THE DEAD HE THAT IS ONCE BURIED WILL BE SEEN NO MORE THAT THE DEAD ARE SEEN NO MORE SAID IMLAC
1601-136862-0019 I WILL NOT UNDERTAKE TO MAINTAIN AGAINST THE CONCURRENT AND UNVARIED TESTIMONY OF ALL AGES AND OF ALL NATIONS THERE IS NO PEOPLE RUDE OR LEARNED AMONG WHOM APPARITIONS OF THE DEAD ARE NOT RELATED AND BELIEVED
1601-136862-0020 COULD BECOME UNIVERSAL ONLY BY ITS TRUTH THOSE THAT NEVER HEARD OF ONE ANOTHER WOULD NOT HAVE AGREED IN A TALE WHICH NOTHING BUT EXPERIENCE CAN MAKE CREDIBLE THAT IT IS DOUBTED BY SINGLE CAVILLERS CAN VERY LITTLE WEAKEN THE GENERAL EVIDENCE
1601-136862-0021 AND SOME WHO DENY IT WITH THEIR TONGUES CONFESS IT BY THEIR FEARS NOTWITHSTANDING MY HIGH ADMIRATION OF RASSELAS
1601-136862-0022 MAY NOT PERHAPS HAVE MADE LIFE APPEAR TO HIM MORE INSIPID AND UNHAPPY THAN IT GENERALLY IS FOR I AM SURE THAT HE HAD LESS ENJOYMENT FROM IT THAN I HAVE
1601-136862-0023 YET WHATEVER ADDITIONAL SHADE HIS OWN PARTICULAR SENSATIONS MAY HAVE THROWN ON HIS REPRESENTATION OF LIFE ATTENTIVE OBSERVATION AND CLOSE ENQUIRY HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT THERE IS TOO MUCH OF REALITY IN THE GLOOMY PICTURE
1601-136862-0024 THE TRUTH HOWEVER IS THAT WE JUDGE OF THE HAPPINESS AND MISERY OF LIFE DIFFERENTLY AT DIFFERENT TIMES ACCORDING TO THE STATE OF OUR CHANGEABLE FRAME
1601-136862-0025 AND WOULD FROM SINCERE BENEVOLENCE IMPRESS UPON ALL WHO HONOUR THIS BOOK WITH A PERUSAL THAT UNTIL A STEADY CONVICTION IS OBTAINED THAT THE PRESENT LIFE IS AN IMPERFECT STATE AND ONLY A PASSAGE TO A BETTER
1601-136862-0026 IF WE COMPLY WITH THE DIVINE SCHEME OF PROGRESSIVE IMPROVEMENT AND ALSO THAT IT IS A PART OF THE MYSTERIOUS PLAN OF PROVIDENCE
1601-136862-0027 BUT IF WE WALK WITH HOPE IN THE MID DAY SUN OF REVELATION OUR TEMPER AND DISPOSITION WILL BE SUCH THAT THE COMFORTS AND ENJOYMENTS IN OUR WAY WILL BE RELISHED
1601-136862-0028 AND OF THE WHOLE BUT A SMALL PART IS TROUBLESOME SMALL DEBTS ARE LIKE SMALL SHOT THEY ARE RATTLING ON EVERY SIDE AND CAN SCARCELY BE ESCAPED WITHOUT A WOUND GREAT DEBTS ARE LIKE CANNON OF LOUD NOISE BUT LITTLE DANGER
1601-136862-0029 YOU MUST THEREFORE BE ENABLED TO DISCHARGE PETTY DEBTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE LEISURE WITH SECURITY TO STRUGGLE WITH THE REST NEITHER THE GREAT NOR LITTLE DEBTS DISGRACE YOU
1601-136862-0030 I AM SURE YOU HAVE MY ESTEEM FOR THE COURAGE WITH WHICH YOU CONTRACTED THEM AND THE SPIRIT WITH WHICH YOU ENDURE THEM I WISH MY ESTEEM COULD BE OF MORE USE I HAVE BEEN INVITED OR HAVE INVITED MYSELF TO SEVERAL PARTS OF THE KINGDOM
1601-136862-0031 AND WILL NOT INCOMMODE MY DEAR LUCY BY COMING TO LICHFIELD WHILE HER PRESENT LODGING IS OF ANY USE TO HER I HOPE IN A FEW DAYS TO BE AT LEISURE AND TO MAKE VISITS WHITHER I SHALL FLY IS MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE
1601-136862-0032 AND OUR LEXICOGRAPHER IS IN GREAT DISTRESS HE SAYS THE BOY IS A SICKLY LAD OF A DELICATE FRAME AND PARTICULARLY SUBJECT TO A MALADY IN HIS THROAT WHICH RENDERS HIM VERY UNFIT FOR HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE
1601-136862-0033 HE WAS HUMBLE ENOUGH TO DESIRE MY ASSISTANCE ON THIS OCCASION THOUGH HE AND I WERE NEVER CATER COUSINS AND I GAVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT I WOULD MAKE APPLICATION TO MY FRIEND MISTER WILKES WHO PERHAPS BY HIS INTEREST WITH DOCTOR HAY AND MISTER ELLIOT
1601-136862-0034 MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROCURE THE DISCHARGE OF HIS LACQUEY IT WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS TO SAY MORE ON THE SUBJECT WHICH I LEAVE TO YOUR OWN CONSIDERATION
1601-136862-0035 BUT I CANNOT LET SLIP THIS OPPORTUNITY OF DECLARING THAT I AM WITH THE MOST INVIOLABLE ESTEEM AND ATTACHMENT DEAR SIR YOUR AFFECTIONATE OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT T SMOLLET MISTER WILKES WHO UPON ALL OCCASIONS HAS ACTED AS A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN
1601-136862-0036 WITH MOST POLITE LIBERALITY APPLIED TO HIS FRIEND SIR GEORGE HAY
