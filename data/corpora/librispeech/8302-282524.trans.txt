8302-282524-0000 CHAPTER FOUR ON THE WAY TO THE RUN IT WAS A BRIGHT MORNING WHEN THEY LEFT SYDNEY TO GO TO THE STATION TAKING THE TRAIN EARLY IN THE DAY FOR THERE WAS A RAILWAY RIDE OF SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE THEM
8302-282524-0001 AS WELL AS A LONG DRIVE NOW YOU ARE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING OF AUSTRALIAN LIFE SAID MISTER MC DONALD LIFE IN SYDNEY OR MELBOURNE IS VERY LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN LIVERPOOL OR GLASGOW
8302-282524-0002 ON THE BIG STATIONS IT IS MUCH THE SAME AS ON THE COUNTRY PLACES AT HOME BUT MY STATION IS TYPICAL OF AUSTRALIA IS IT IN THE BUSH UNCLE ASKED FERGUS HEAR THE LADDIE TALKING LIKE AN OLD SQUATTER
8302-282524-0003 LAUGHED MISTER MC DONALD YES AND NO YOU SEE THE AUSTRALIANS WHO LIVE IN THE CITIES CONSIDER ALL THE REST OF THE CONTINENT THE BUSH BUT TO THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE GRAZING AND FARMING DISTRICTS
8302-282524-0004 THE COUNTRY INLAND IS THE BUSH OR THE BACK COUNTRY OUR RUN IS BEAUTIFULLY SITUATED JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE DIVIDING RANGE AND WE ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A RIVER RUNNING THROUGH ONE SIDE
8302-282524-0005 SO THAT THE RUN IS SELDOM DRY WHAT IS THE DIVIDING RANGE ASKED FERGUS WHO WAS DETERMINED TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING HE HEARD IF HE DID NOT IT WAS NOT BECAUSE HE DID NOT ASK QUESTIONS ENOUGH ABOUT IT
8302-282524-0006 THE DIVIDING RANGE IS THE HIGH LAND WHICH SEPARATES THE EAST AND WEST OF THE CONTINENT AND RUNS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ALONG THE COAST IT IS SOMETIMES CALLED THE AUSTRALIAN ALPS
8302-282524-0007 AND SOME OF THE PEAKS ARE SEVEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH THE EASTERN PART OF AUSTRALIA RUNS IN A LONG STRIP OF FERTILE GROUND ALONG THE COAST WEST OF THIS ARE THE MOUNTAINS AND BEYOND THEM IS A HIGH PLATEAU
8302-282524-0008 WHICH SLOPES DOWN TO THE PLAINS OF CENTRAL AUSTRALIA THIS CENTRAL PORTION IS AN ALMOST UNKNOWN COUNTRY THERE ARE NO GREAT RIVERS AND LITTLE RAIN THE LAND IS TERRIBLY DRY AND VERY HOT
8302-282524-0009 MANY WHO HAVE GONE TO EXPLORE IT HAVE NEVER RETURNED AND NO ONE KNOWS THEIR FATE PERHAPS THEY HAVE DIED OF THIRST PERHAPS THEY HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE BLACKS THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY
8302-282524-0010 ASKED FERGUS AS HIS UNCLE PAUSED
8302-282524-0011 WERE YOU A SQUATTER HIS UNCLE'S HEARTY LAUGH RANG OUT NO MY BOY BUT I BOUGHT MY RUN FROM A SQUATTER HE ANSWERED THE DAYS OF SQUATTERS WERE ABOUT OVER WHEN I CAME OUT
8302-282524-0012 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT SQUATTERS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ANSWERED FERGUS ONLY I HAVE HEARD THE NAME AND THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WOULD TELL US ABOUT THEM IN THE OLD TIMES
8302-282524-0013 BEFORE AUSTRALIA HAD STARTED IN THE TRADE THE WOOL FROM THE SHEEP ON THE RUNS WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO HER SAID MISTER MC DONALD MEN WOULD COME OUT TO THE COUNTRY AND NOT HAVING VERY MUCH MONEY
8302-282524-0014 THEY COULD PERHAPS BUY A SMALL HOMESTEAD AND STOCK IT BUT LITTLE MORE THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE LARGE TRACTS OF LAND TO PASTURE THEIR SHEEP BUT HAD NOT MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY THE LAND THEY THEREFORE SETTLED DOWN
8302-282524-0015 AND TOOK WHAT THEY NEEDED WITHOUT PERMISSION AND SO WERE CALLED SQUATTERS THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT INTERFERE WITH THEM BECAUSE THE WOOL FROM THEIR SHEEP WAS NEEDED AND BECAUSE THE COUNTRY WAS SO BIG THERE SEEMED LAND ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE
8302-282524-0016 IN TIME THE MATTER WAS ARRANGED BY THE GOVERNMENT'S DIVIDING THE BACK COUNTRY INTO GRAZING DISTRICTS WHICH ALL THE SQUATTERS MIGHT USE BY PAYING A YEARLY RENT HOW DID THE SQUATTERS KEEP THEIR SHEEP FROM OTHER PEOPLE
8302-282524-0017 FERGUS INQUIRED EVERY FLOCK HAD ITS SHEPHERD WHO LED IT WHEREVER FOOD AND WATER WERE TO BE FOUND WAS THE ANSWER THE LIFE OF A SHEPHERD WAS A LONELY ONE HE HAD TO WATCH THE SHEEP AND LAMBS
8302-282524-0018 THE SHEPHERD NEVER SAW ANY OTHER PEOPLE EXCEPT THE MAN WHO BROUGHT HIS SUPPLIES FROM THE STATION HIS DOGS WERE HIS ONLY FRIENDS AND OFTEN THESE SHEPHERD DOGS ARE MARVELS OF INTELLIGENCE AND LOYALTY FOR A TIME
8302-282524-0019 THE SQUATTERS PROSPERED AND SOME OF THEM GREW IMMENSELY WEALTHY THESE WERE CALLED WOOL KINGS AND LIVED ON THEIR STATIONS EXTRAVAGANTLY
8302-282524-0020 BUT SHEEP RAISING IS NOT ALL PLAIN SAILING IN AUSTRALIA RABBITS WERE BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY AND THESE PROVED TO BE A REGULAR PLAGUE DESTROYING THE GRASS SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT PASSED A LAW THAT SQUATTERS MUST HELP TO EXTERMINATE THEM
8302-282524-0021 WHICH PUT THEM TO A GREAT EXPENSE WHEN I CAME HERE TWENTY YEARS AGO I GOT MY STATION FROM A SQUATTER WHO HAD WORKED IT FOR YEARS AND HAD MADE ENOUGH TO SELL OUT AND GO TO SYDNEY WHERE IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN HIS AMBITION TO LIVE
8302-282524-0022 I HAVE WORKED HARD AND BEEN SUCCESSFUL WHEN YOU SEE OUR STATION I THINK YOU WILL WANT TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIND GOLD IN NEVER NEVER LAND HE SAID TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW PERHAPS I SHALL
8302-282524-0023 BUT I HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY A STATION AND I CAN'T BE A SQUATTER NOW SAID MISTER HUME THEIR WAY LAY THROUGH A BEAUTIFUL SEMI TROPICAL COUNTRY THE TRAIN MOVED THROUGH FERTILE VALLEYS FINE WOODLAND AND GREEN VALES
8302-282524-0024 AND BRIDGED COOL MOUNTAIN STREAMS WHEN THEIR STOPPING PLACE WAS REACHED AND THEY ALIGHTED FROM THE TRAIN TO FIND A COMFORTABLE CART AND GOOD HORSES AWAITING THEM FERGUS EXCLAIMED
8302-282524-0025 WAIT TILL YOU GET TO THE BUSH SAID HIS UNCLE
8302-282524-0026 MAKE YOUR OWN SUPPER OVER A TWIG FIRE
8302-282524-0027 AND ROLL UP IN A BLANKET TO SLEEP
8302-282524-0028 THAT'S REAL AUSTRALIA FOR YOU I LIKE YOUR KIND BETTER SAID JEAN WITH A SHUDDER BUT FERGUS SAID BOASTINGLY WELL I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE BUSH WAIT AND SEE SAID HIS FATHER
8302-282524-0029 AS THEY DROVE THROUGH THE GATE WHICH LED INTO MISTER MC DONALD'S RUN IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL STATION AND WELL SUITED FOR THE SHEEP FARMING FROM WHICH THE OWNER HAD MADE HIS MONEY THE LAND LAY IN A TRIANGLE ON TWO SIDES OF WHICH WAS A CONSIDERABLE STREAM
8302-282524-0030 WHILE THE MAIN ROAD FORMED THE THIRD BOUNDARY THE LAND WAS FENCED WITH STOUT RAIL FENCES WHILE THE PADDOCKS WERE FENCED WITH WIRE THE HOUSE WAS BUILT OF STONE OF ONE STORY WITH A BROAD VERANDA RUNNING AROUND ALL FOUR SIDES
8302-282524-0031 SHADED IN VINES AND LOOKING ON A GARDEN IN WHICH GORGEOUS HUED FLOWERS BLOOMED IN BRILLIANT BEAUTY THERE WAS AN AIR OF GREAT COMFORT ABOUT THE PLACE HAMMOCKS WERE SLUNG IN THE PORCHES AND EASY CHAIRS WERE PLACED INVITINGLY ABOUT
8302-282524-0032 LONG WINDOWS CLEAR TO THE FLOOR OPENED INTO THE LIVING ROOMS AND A WIDE HALLWAY RAN THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE ON ONE SIDE WAS A DRAWING ROOM AT THE OTHER DINING ROOM AND LIVING ROOM
8302-282524-0033 THE GUESTS CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF BOOKS AND MUSIC AS THEY WERE USHERED INTO THEIR COOL BEDROOMS THESE OPENED ON TO THE VERANDA AND WERE COOL AND PLEASANT WITH GAY CHINTZ AND WHITE HANGINGS
8302-282524-0034 WHAT A DELIGHTFUL VISIT THE CHILDREN HAD AT THE RUN IT WAS PERHAPS PLEASANTER FOR THEM THAN FOR THE GROWN FOLK FOR SANDY MISTER AND MISSUS MC DONALD'S ONLY CHILD A BOY OF TEN WAS A PERFECT IMP OF MISCHIEF
8302-282524-0035 AND HE LED HIS TWO COUSINS INTO EVERYTHING THAT HE COULD THINK OF FERGUS WAS NOT FAR BEHIND AND JEAN TRUDGED AFTER THE BOYS GROWING STRONG AND ROSY IN THE AUSTRALIAN SUNSHINE
8302-282524-0036 AUSTRALIA IS MAKING THE GREATEST CHANGE IN JEAN SAID HER MOTHER TO MISSUS MC DONALD ONE DAY AS THEY SAT UPON THE VERANDA AT HOME SHE WAS SO SHY SHE WOULD SCARCELY LOOK AT ANY ONE SHE SEEMED DELICATE
8302-282524-0037 SAID HER SISTER SHE IS A DEAR LITTLE GIRL AND I THINK THERE IS PLENTY OF STRENGTH OF CHARACTER UNDER HER SHY LITTLE WAYS
8302-282524-0038 SAID JEAN'S MOTHER IT HAS BEEN SOME TIME SINCE WE HEARD A SHRIEK OF ANY KIND OH WHAT IS THAT FOR AS SHE SPOKE THERE CAME A SCREAM SO LOUD AND PIERCING FROM THE SHRUBBERY
8302-282524-0039 THAT BOTH WOMEN SPRANG TO THEIR FEET AND RUSHED ACROSS THE LAWN
8302-282524-0040 BOTH BOYS HOLDING JEAN'S HANDS AND HELPING HER TO RUN TO THE HOUSE WHILE THE LITTLE GIRL HER FACE COVERED WITH BLOOD AND TEARS WAS TRYING NOT TO CRY JEAN'S HURT CRIED SANDY SO I SHOULD JUDGE
8302-282524-0041 SAID HIS MOTHER TRYING TO KEEP CALM WHILE BOTH BOYS BEGAN TO TALK AT ONCE SO THAT NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND A WORD THEY SAID MISSUS HUME GATHERED JEAN IN HER ARMS AND CARRIED HER QUICKLY TO THE HOUSE
8302-282524-0042 WHERE SHE WASHED THE LITTLE TEAR STAINED FACE THE CHILD'S LIP WAS TERRIBLY CUT AND SHE WAS BADLY FRIGHTENED BUT NOT SERIOUSLY HURT AND AS SHE CUDDLED DOWN IN HER MOTHER'S ARMS SHE SIGHED NICE MOTHER
8302-282524-0043 TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED DEAR SAID HER MOTHER AS SHE STROKED THE FAIR HAIR WE WERE PLAYING JEAN SAID THE BOYS HAD STICKS AND WE HEARD A QUEER RUSTLE IN THE BUSHES
8302-282524-0044 SANDY SAID IT WAS A SNAKE AND BEAT THE BUSHES TO DRIVE HIM OUT IT RAN OUT JUST IN FRONT OF FERGUS AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BITE HIM AND I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO MY BROTHER
8302-282524-0045 SO I RAN UP BEHIND HIM JUST AS HE SWUNG HIS STICK OVER HIS SHOULDER TO HIT THE SNAKE HE HIT ME IN THE MOUTH BUT OF COURSE HE DIDN'T MEAN TO MOTHER I SCREAMED BECAUSE IT HURT ME SO AND THEN I TRIED NOT TO CRY BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD WORRY YOU

8302-282524-0048 FERGUS AND SANDY UNDOUBTEDLY WOULD THEY WERE VERY KIND TO JEAN BUT THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THEY FOUND THE LITTLE GIRL A CLOG UPON THEIR MOVEMENTS FERGUS WAS USED TO TAKING CARE OF HER BUT SANDY HAD NO SISTERS
8302-282524-0049 AND HE SOMETIMES WISHED THE LITTLE COUSIN WOULD NOT TAG QUITE SO MUCH YOU CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING MUCH WHEN A GIRL IS TAGGING AROUND HE SAID TO HIS MOTHER BUT THAT LONG SUFFERING WOMAN PROVED STRANGELY UNSYMPATHETIC
8302-282524-0050 I THINK I SHALL KEEP JEAN ALWAYS IF HER BEING HERE KEEPS YOU OUT OF MISCHIEF SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AND SANDY ANSWERED WELL KEEP FERGUS TOO THEN NO SOONER WAS JEAN ASLEEP
8302-282524-0051 THAN THE BOYS DECIDED THE TIME HAD COME FOR THEM TO CARRY OUT A PLAN LONG SINCE FORMED BUT LAID ASIDE FOR A CONVENIENT SEASON AT ONE SIDE OF THE RUN WAS A LITTLE LAKE FORMED WHERE ONE OF THE BOUNDARY STREAMS WAS DAMMED
8302-282524-0052 A WINDMILL CARRIED WATER FROM THIS TO A PLATFORM AND UPON THIS WERE IRON TANKS FROM WHICH PIPES CARRIED WATER THROUGH THE HOUSE THE BOYS HAD DECIDED TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE RESERVOIR AND SLIDE DOWN THE PIPES
8302-282524-0053 WHICH SEEMED TO THEM WOULD BE AN EXCITING PERFORMANCE THE CLIMBING UP WAS NOT DIFFICULT AND SANDY TOOK THE FIRST SLIDE IT'S GREAT FUN HE SHOUTED
