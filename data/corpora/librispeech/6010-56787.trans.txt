6010-56787-0000 AND BY WHICH THEY AT THE SAME TIME REVOLUTIONIZED THE SCIENCE OF THE STARS FOR THEY HAD NOT ONLY TO DESIGN AND MAKE THE SPECULA BUT ALSO THE MOUNTINGS OF THE MIRRORS AS WELL AND IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE MONEY REQUIRED FOR MATERIAL AND WORKMEN
6010-56787-0001 WHEN SIR WILLIAM WATSON HEARD THAT THIS LIMITED SUM HAD BEEN GRANTED BY GEORGE THE THIRD TO THE DISCOVERER OF GEORGIUM SIDUS THE PLANET NOW KNOWN AS URANUS HE EXCLAIMED
6010-56787-0002 NEVER BOUGHT MONARCH HONOR SO CHEAP SHORTLY AFTERWARDS CAROLINE WAS APPOINTED AS ASSISTANT TO HER BROTHER
6010-56787-0003 THIS WE SHOULD NOW CONSIDER BUT A NOMINAL SUM BUT SHE MANAGED TO LIVE ON IT
6010-56787-0004 IF NOT IN THE WORLD TO HOLD SUCH A POSITION IN THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE
6010-56787-0005 SHE DEVOTED HER TIME TO WHAT SHE QUAINTLY CALLED MINDING THE HEAVENS IT WAS DURING THIS PERIOD THAT SHE MADE HER MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES AS ASSISTANT HOWEVER TO SO INDEFATIGABLE AN OBSERVER AS SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL
6010-56787-0006 CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING WITHOUT REGARD TO SEASONS IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF HIS ASSISTANT TO NOTE THE CLOCKS AND TO WRITE DOWN THE OBSERVATIONS FROM HIS DICTATIONS AS THEY WERE MADE
6010-56787-0007 THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO DEVOTE HERSELF TO THE NEWTONIAN SWEEPER WHICH SHE USED TO SUCH GOOD PURPOSE BESIDES THE EIGHT COMETS BY HER DISCOVERED
6010-56787-0008 THAT WERE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THAT MADE CAROLINE HERSCHEL SO VALUABLE AS AN ASSISTANT TO HER BROTHER AND ENABLED HIM TO ACHIEVE THE UNIQUE POSITION WHICH IS HIS AMONG THE WORLD'S GREATEST ASTRONOMERS HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO DEVOTE ALL HER TIME TO MINDING THE HEAVENS
6010-56787-0009 IT IS CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULD HAVE MADE MANY MORE DISCOVERIES THAN ARE NOW CREDITED TO HER BUT HER SERVICE TO ASTRONOMY WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS THAN IT WAS AS THE AUXILIARY OF HER ILLUSTRIOUS BROTHER NO TWO EVER DID BETTER TEAMWORK
6010-56787-0010 NO TWO WERE EVER MORE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER OR EXHIBITED GREATER ENTHUSIASM IN THE TASK TO WHICH THEY SO
6010-56787-0011 AND ASSISTANT TO HER BROTHER CAROLINE FOUND TIME TO PREPARE A NUMBER OF WORKS FOR THE PRESS AMONG THESE WERE A CATALOGUE OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY STARS OBSERVED BY FLAMSTEED BUT NOT INCLUDED IN THE BRITISH CATALOGUE
6010-56787-0012 AND A GENERAL INDEX OF REFERENCE TO EVERY OBSERVATION OF EVERY STAR IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED BRITISH CATALOGUE
6010-56787-0013 ANOTHER AND A MORE VALUABLE WORK WAS
6010-56787-0014 IT WAS FOR THIS CATALOGUE THAT A GOLD MEDAL WAS VOTED TO HER BY THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT A PRODUCTION THAT WAS CHARACTERIZED AS A WORK OF IMMENSE LABOR AND
6010-56787-0015 AN EXTRAORDINARY MONUMENT TO THE UNEXTINGUISHED ARDOR OF A LADY OF SEVENTY FIVE IN THE CAUSE OF ABSTRACT SCIENCE TO HER NEPHEW SIR JOHN HERSCHEL IT PROVED INVALUABLE AS IT SUPPLIED THE NEEDFUL DATA
6010-56787-0016 IT WAS ALSO A FITTING PRELUDE TO SIR JOHN'S CAPE OBSERVATIONS A COPY OF WHICH GREAT WORK SHE RECEIVED FROM HER NEPHEW NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SUBSEQUENTLY
6010-56787-0017 AFTER HE HAD COMPLETED HIS FAMOUS OBSERVATIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HEAVENS IN HIS OBSERVATORY AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE BY A MOST STRIKING AND HAPPY COINCIDENCE WRITES MISSUS JOHN HERSCHEL
6010-56787-0018 SHE WHOSE UNFLAGGING TOIL HAD SO GREATLY CONTRIBUTED TO ITS SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION IN THE HANDS OF HER BELOVED BROTHER LIVED TO WITNESS ITS TRIUMPHANT TERMINATION THROUGH THE NO LESS PERSISTENT INDUSTRY AND STRENUOUS LABOR OF HIS SON
6010-56787-0019 AND HER LAST DAYS WERE CROWNED BY THE POSSESSION OF THE WORK WHICH BROUGHT TO ITS GLORIOUS CONCLUSION SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL'S VAST UNDERTAKING THE SURVEY
6010-56787-0020 IS EVIDENCED BY THE HONORS OF WHICH SHE WAS THE RECIPIENT THE FIRST OF THESE HONORS CAME IN THE FORM OF A GOLD MEDAL UNANIMOUSLY AWARDED BY THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY FOR HER REDUCTION OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED NEBULAE
6010-56787-0021 DISCOVERED BY HER ILLUSTRIOUS BROTHER WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE COMPLETION OF A SERIES OF EXERTIONS PROBABLY UNPARALLELED EITHER IN MAGNITUDE OR IMPORTANCE IN THE ANNALS OF ASTRONOMICAL LABOR
6010-56787-0022 IT WAS ON THIS OCCASION WHEN REFERRING TO THE IMMENSITY OF THE TASK WHICH SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL HAD UNDERTAKEN THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY PAID A DESERVING TRIBUTE TO THE GREAT ASTRONOMER'S DEVOTED SISTER IN WHICH IS FOUND THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT
6010-56787-0023 SHE IT WAS WHO NOTED THE RIGHT ASCENSIONS AND POLAR DISTANCES OF THE OBJECTS OBSERVED SHE IT WAS WHO HAVING PASSED THE NIGHT NEAR THE INSTRUMENT TOOK THE ROUGH MANUSCRIPTS TO HER COTTAGE AT THE DAWN OF DAY
6010-56787-0024 IN RECOGNITION OF THE VALUABLE SERVICES RENDERED BY HER AS THE FELLOW WORKER OF HER IMMORTAL BROTHER SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL
6010-56787-0025 THOUGH UPON WHAT IT MIGHT CONSIDER NARROW GROUNDS AND FALSE PRINCIPLES
6010-56787-0026 SHOULD IN NO CASE BE APPLIED TO THE WORKS OF A WOMAN LESS SEVERELY THAN TO THOSE OF A MAN THE SEX OF THE FORMER SHOULD NO LONGER BE AN OBSTACLE
6010-56787-0027 AND YOUR COUNCIL THEREFORE
6010-56787-0028 NOTHING IN THE POWER OF MAN TO BESTOW COULD HAVE GIVEN SUCH PLEASURE ON HER DEATH BED AS THIS LAST
6010-56787-0029 WE ARE TOLD THAT A COPY JUST FROM THE PRESS OF HIS IMMORTAL WORK DE ORBIUM CELESTIUM REVOLUTIONIBUS
6010-56787-0030 IN WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED THE HELIOCENTRIC THEORY OF THE PLANETARY SYSTEM WAS PLACED IN THE HANDS OF COPERNICUS ON THE DAY OF HIS DEATH JUST A FEW HOURS BEFORE HE EXPIRED HE SEEMED CONSCIOUS OF WHAT IT WAS
6010-56787-0031 BUT AFTER TOUCHING IT AND CONTEMPLATING IT FOR A MOMENT HE LAPSED INTO A STATE OF INSENSIBILITY WHICH SOON TERMINATED IN DEATH WITH MISS HERSCHEL THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT ALTHOUGH IN HER NINETY SEVENTH
6010-56787-0032 SHE STILL RETAINED POSSESSION OF ALL HER FACULTIES AND WAS FULLY ABLE TO APPRECIATE THE VOLUME WHICH TOLD OF THE CROWNING OF HER BROTHER'S LIFE WORK A VOLUME WHICH MUST HAVE GIVEN HER ADDITIONAL SATISFACTION WHEN SHE RECALLED HER FIFTY YEARS OF LOYAL SERVICE AT HER BROTHER'S SIDE
6010-56787-0033 AS HIS ASSOCIATE AND MINISTERING ANGEL IN THE GREATEST WORK EVER UNDERTAKEN BY A SINGLE MAN IN THE HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY
6010-56787-0034 WHICH HAD OCCUPIED HER MIND FOR MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF A CENTURY HER EPITAPH COMPOSED BY HERSELF IS ENGRAVED ON A HEAVY STONE SLAB WHICH COVERS HER GRAVE AND CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING WORDS
6010-56787-0035 THE EYES OF HER WHO IS GLORIFIED WERE HERE BELOW TURNED TO THE STARRY HEAVENS HER OWN DISCOVERIES OF COMETS AND HER PARTICIPATION IN THE IMMORTAL LABORS OF HER BROTHER WILLIAM HERSCHEL
6010-56787-0036 SECURED FOR HER SO ENVIABLE A PLACE AMONG THE MATHEMATICIANS OF HER TIME AND PLACED ALL ENGLISH STUDENTS OF MATHEMATICAL ASTRONOMY UNDER SUCH DEEP OBLIGATIONS IT IS TRUE THAT SHE EVER MANIFESTED A LIVELY INTEREST IN CELESTIAL PHENOMENA
6010-56787-0037 BUT IT IS RATHER AS A MATHEMATICIAN THAN AS AN ASTRONOMER THAT SHE WILL BE REMEMBERED BY THE DEVOTEES OF SCIENCE THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMAN TO WIN DISTINCTION IN ASTRONOMY WAS MISS MARIA MITCHELL
6010-56787-0038 BORN IN THE ISLAND OF NANTUCKET IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN SHE AT AN EARLY AGE DISPLAYED REMARKABLE TALENT FOR ASTRONOMY AND MATHEMATICS HER FIRST INSTRUCTOR WAS HER FATHER WHO BESIDES BEING A SCHOOL TEACHER

6010-56787-0047 AS THERE WAS NO ATLANTIC CABLE IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHO WAS THE FORTUNATE WINNER OF THE PRIZE UNTIL NEARLY A YEAR AFTERWARD
6010-56787-0048 WHEN WORD WAS RECEIVED FROM DENMARK ANNOUNCING THAT THE PRIORITY OF MISS MITCHELL'S DISCOVERY HAD BEEN RECOGNIZED AND THAT SHE WOULD BE THE RECIPIENT OF THE PRIZE WHICH FOR A WHILE IT WAS THOUGHT WOULD GO TO DE VICO OR MADAME RUEMKER

6010-56787-0055 SHE EXHIBITED A SPECIAL INTEREST IN SHOOTING STARS AND PREPARED THE FIRST CATALOGUE OF THESE METEORS OBSERVED IN ITALY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR SHE DISCOVERED A COMET SHE HAS ALSO LEFT VALUABLE STUDIES ON THE PROBABLE INFLUENCE OF THE MOON ON EARTHQUAKES
6010-56787-0056 ANOTHER WOMAN WHO HAS WON ENDURING FAME IN THE ANNALS OF ASTRONOMY
6010-56787-0057 OF SAN FRANCISCO WHILE YET QUITE YOUNG
6010-56787-0058 THERE SHE SOON BECAME PROFICIENT IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEN DEVOTED HERSELF TO THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS AND ASTRONOMY AFTER SECURING HER BACCALAUREATE AND LICENTIATE IN PARIS
6010-56787-0059 SHE APPLIED FOR ADMISSION AS A STUDENT TO THE PARIS OBSERVATORY THE DIRECTORS OF THE OBSERVATORY CONSULTED THE STATUTES NO WOMAN HAD HITHERTO PROPOSED HERSELF AS A COLLEAGUE BUT THERE WAS NO RULE OPPOSING IT

6010-56787-0068 FOR MANY YEARS MISSUS W FLEMING
6010-56787-0069 TO HER AND HER STAFF WERE ASSIGNED THE REDUCTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC AND PHOTOMETRIC WORK DONE IN CAMBRIDGE AND AREQUIPA PERU SHE WAS SINGULARLY SUCCESSFUL IN HER STUDIES OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATES
6010-56787-0070 AND WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ITS ADVANCEMENT BY THEIR OBSERVATIONS AND WRITINGS WOULD BE A VERY LONG ONE
6010-56787-0071 MENTION MUST BE MADE OF THE MISSES ANTONIA C MAURY FLORENCE CUSHMAN LOUISA D WELLS MABEL C STEPHENS
6010-56787-0072 ANNA WINLOCK ANNIE J CANNON AND HENRIETTA S LEAVITT
6010-56787-0073 THEN TOO THERE ARE MANY WOMEN WHO OCCUPY IMPORTANT POSITIONS AS PROFESSORS OR ASSISTANT PROFESSORS IN OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
