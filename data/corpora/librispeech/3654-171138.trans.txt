3654-171138-0000 CHAPTER FOUR JOSEPHUS MAKES AN ATTEMPT UPON SEPPHORIS BUT IS REPELLED
3654-171138-0001 AND SIX THOUSAND FOOTMEN UNDER PLACIDUS THE TRIBUNE
3654-171138-0002 THE FOOT WERE PUT INTO THE CITY TO BE A GUARD TO IT BUT THE HORSE LODGED ABROAD IN THE CAMP
3654-171138-0003 BEFORE THEY REVOLTED FROM THE REST OF THE GALILEANS THAT THE ROMANS WOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO TAKE IT BY WHICH MEANS HE PROVED TOO WEAK AND FAILED OF HIS HOPES BOTH AS TO THE FORCING THE PLACE AND AS TO HIS PREVAILING WITH THE PEOPLE OF SEPPHORIS TO DELIVER IT UP TO HIM
3654-171138-0004 AND STEALING AWAY THE CATTLE THAT WERE IN THE COUNTRY AND KILLING WHATSOEVER APPEARED CAPABLE OF FIGHTING PERPETUALLY AND LEADING THE WEAKER PEOPLE AS SLAVES INTO CAPTIVITY SO THAT GALILEE WAS ALL OVER FILLED WITH FIRE AND BLOOD
3654-171138-0005 AND THAT SOONER THAN THE WINTER SEASON DID USUALLY PERMIT SO HE TOOK WITH HIM THOSE FORCES HE WAS SENT FOR AND MARCHING WITH GREAT EXPEDITION HE CAME SUDDENLY TO PTOLEMAIS AND THERE FINDING HIS FATHER TOGETHER WITH THE TWO LEGIONS THE FIFTH AND THE TENTH
3654-171138-0006 WHICH WERE THE MOST EMINENT LEGIONS OF ALL HE JOINED THEM TO THAT FIFTEENTH LEGION WHICH WAS WITH HIS FATHER EIGHTEEN COHORTS FOLLOWED THESE LEGIONS
3654-171138-0007 WITH ONE TROOP OF HORSEMEN AND FIVE OTHER TROOPS OF HORSEMEN FROM SYRIA NOW THESE TEN COHORTS HAD SEVERALLY A THOUSAND FOOTMEN BUT THE OTHER THIRTEEN COHORTS HAD NO MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED FOOTMEN APIECE WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY HORSEMEN
3654-171138-0008 THERE WERE ALSO A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF AUXILIARIES GOT TOGETHER THAT CAME FROM THE KINGS ANTIOCHUS AND AGRIPPA AND SOHEMUS EACH OF THEM CONTRIBUTING ONE THOUSAND FOOTMEN THAT WERE ARCHERS AND A THOUSAND HORSEMEN
3654-171138-0009 MALCHUS ALSO THE KING OF ARABIA SENT A THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES FIVE THOUSAND FOOTMEN THE GREATEST PART OF WHICH WERE ARCHERS
3654-171138-0010 WHEN ALL WERE UNITED TOGETHER AMOUNTED TO SIXTY THOUSAND BESIDES THE SERVANTS WHO AS THEY FOLLOWED IN VAST NUMBERS
3654-171138-0011 OUGHT NOT TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE FIGHTING MEN FOR AS THEY WERE IN THEIR MASTERS SERVICE IN TIMES OF PEACE SO DID THEY UNDERGO THE LIKE DANGERS WITH THEM IN TIMES OF WAR INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE INFERIOR TO NONE EITHER IN SKILL OR IN STRENGTH
3654-171138-0012 ONLY THEY WERE SUBJECT TO THEIR MASTERS
3654-171138-0013 IN PROVIDING THEMSELVES OF SUCH HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS AS MIGHT NOT ONLY SERVE AT OTHER TIMES FOR THE COMMON OFFICES OF LIFE BUT MIGHT ALSO BE OF ADVANTAGE TO THEM IN THEIR WARS
3654-171138-0014 BUT EVERY SOLDIER IS EVERY DAY EXERCISED AND THAT WITH GREAT DILIGENCE AS IF IT WERE IN TIME OF WAR WHICH IS THE REASON WHY THEY BEAR THE FATIGUE OF BATTLES SO EASILY
3654-171138-0015 NOR CAN FEAR AFFRIGHT THEM OUT OF IT NOR CAN LABOR TIRE THEM WHICH FIRMNESS OF CONDUCT MAKES THEM ALWAYS TO OVERCOME THOSE THAT HAVE NOT THE SAME FIRMNESS
3654-171138-0016 NOR WOULD HE BE MISTAKEN THAT SHOULD CALL THOSE THEIR EXERCISES UNBLOODY BATTLES AND THEIR BATTLES BLOODY EXERCISES NOR CAN THEIR ENEMIES EASILY SURPRISE THEM WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF THEIR INCURSIONS
3654-171138-0017 NOR IS THE FENCE THEY RAISE RASHLY MADE OR UNEVEN
3654-171138-0018 NOR DO THOSE THAT ARE IN IT TAKE THEIR PLACES AT RANDOM BUT IF IT HAPPENS THAT THE GROUND IS UNEVEN IT IS FIRST LEVELED THEIR CAMP IS ALSO FOUR SQUARE BY MEASURE
3654-171138-0019 AND WHERE THEY LAY ALL OTHER ENGINES THAT CAN ANNOY THE ENEMY ALL READY FOR THEIR SEVERAL OPERATIONS THEY ALSO ERECT FOUR GATES ONE AT EVERY SIDE OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE AND THOSE LARGE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTRANCE OF THE BEASTS
3654-171138-0020 AND WIDE ENOUGH FOR MAKING EXCURSIONS IF OCCASION SHOULD REQUIRE THEY DIVIDE THE CAMP WITHIN INTO STREETS VERY CONVENIENTLY AND PLACE THE TENTS OF THE COMMANDERS IN THE MIDDLE
3654-171138-0021 WITH ITS MARKET PLACE AND PLACE FOR HANDICRAFT TRADES AND WITH SEATS FOR THE OFFICERS SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR WHERE IF ANY DIFFERENCES ARISE THEIR CAUSES ARE HEARD AND DETERMINED THE CAMP AND ALL THAT IS IN IT
3654-171138-0022 FOR THEY NEITHER SUP NOR DINE AS THEY PLEASE THEMSELVES SINGLY BUT ALL TOGETHER THEIR TIMES ALSO FOR SLEEPING AND WATCHING AND RISING ARE NOTIFIED BEFOREHAND BY THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS NOR IS ANY THING DONE WITHOUT SUCH A SIGNAL
3654-171138-0023 TO BE BY THEM CARRIED TO ALL THAT ARE UNDER THEIR COMMAND WHICH IS ALSO OBSERVED WHEN THEY GO TO FIGHT
3654-171138-0024 THEN DO THEY LAY THEIR BAGGAGE SUDDENLY UPON THEIR MULES AND OTHER BEASTS OF BURDEN AND STAND AS AT THE PLACE OF STARTING READY TO MARCH WHEN ALSO THEY SET FIRE TO THEIR CAMP AND THIS THEY DO BECAUSE IT WILL BE EASY FOR THEM TO ERECT ANOTHER CAMP
3654-171138-0025 THEN DO THE TRUMPETS GIVE A SOUND THE THIRD TIME THAT THEY ARE TO GO OUT IN ORDER TO EXCITE THOSE THAT ON ANY ACCOUNT ARE A LITTLE TARDY
3654-171138-0026 TO WHICH THEY REPLY AS OFTEN WITH A LOUD AND CHEERFUL VOICE SAYING WE ARE READY AND THIS THEY DO ALMOST BEFORE THE QUESTION IS ASKED THEM THEY DO THIS AS FILLED WITH A KIND OF MARTIAL FURY
3654-171138-0027 THEY ALL MARCH WITHOUT NOISE AND IN A DECENT MANNER AND EVERY ONE KEEPS HIS OWN RANK AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO WAR THE FOOTMEN ARE ARMED WITH BREASTPLATES AND HEAD PIECES AND HAVE SWORDS ON EACH SIDE
3654-171138-0028 BUT THE REST OF THE FOOT SOLDIERS HAVE A SPEAR AND A LONG BUCKLER BESIDES A SAW AND A BASKET A PICK AXE AND AN AXE A THONG OF LEATHER AND A HOOK WITH PROVISIONS FOR THREE DAYS
3654-171138-0029 SO THAT A FOOTMAN HATH NO GREAT NEED OF A MULE TO CARRY HIS BURDENS THE HORSEMEN HAVE A LONG SWORD ON THEIR RIGHT SIDES AXED A LONG POLE IN THEIR HAND A SHIELD ALSO LIES BY THEM OBLIQUELY ON ONE SIDE OF THEIR HORSES
3654-171138-0030 BUT WHEN THEY ARE TO FIGHT THEY LEAVE NOTHING WITHOUT FORECAST NOR TO BE DONE OFF HAND
3654-171138-0031 FOR WHICH REASON THEY SELDOM COMMIT ANY ERRORS AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AT ANY TIME THEY EASILY CORRECT THOSE MISTAKES
3654-171138-0032 THEY ALSO ESTEEM ANY ERRORS THEY COMMIT UPON TAKING COUNSEL BEFOREHAND TO BE BETTER THAN SUCH RASH SUCCESS AS IS OWING TO FORTUNE ONLY BECAUSE SUCH A FORTUITOUS ADVANTAGE TEMPTS THEM TO BE INCONSIDERATE WHILE CONSULTATION THOUGH IT MAY SOMETIMES FAIL OF SUCCESS
3654-171138-0033 THEY ARE MOREOVER HARDENED FOR WAR BY FEAR FOR THEIR LAWS INFLICT CAPITAL PUNISHMENTS NOT ONLY FOR SOLDIERS RUNNING AWAY FROM THE RANKS BUT FOR SLOTHFULNESS AND INACTIVITY THOUGH IT BE BUT IN A LESSER DEGREE
3654-171138-0034 AS ARE THEIR GENERALS MORE SEVERE THAN THEIR LAWS FOR THEY PREVENT ANY IMPUTATION OF CRUELTY TOWARD THOSE UNDER CONDEMNATION BY THE GREAT REWARDS THEY BESTOW ON THE VALIANT SOLDIERS AND THE READINESS OF OBEYING THEIR COMMANDERS IS SO GREAT
3654-171138-0035 BUT WHEN THEY COME TO A BATTLE THE WHOLE ARMY IS BUT ONE BODY SO WELL COUPLED TOGETHER ARE THEIR RANKS SO SUDDEN ARE THEIR TURNINGS ABOUT SO SHARP THEIR HEARING AS TO WHAT ORDERS ARE GIVEN THEM SO QUICK THEIR SIGHT OF THE ENSIGNS
3654-171138-0036 AND SO NIMBLE ARE THEIR HANDS WHEN THEY SET TO WORK WHEREBY IT COMES TO PASS THAT WHAT THEY DO IS DONE QUICKLY AND WHAT THEY SUFFER THEY BEAR WITH THE GREATEST PATIENCE
3654-171138-0037 NOR CAN WE FIND ANY EXAMPLES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN CONQUERED IN BATTLE WHEN THEY CAME TO A CLOSE FIGHT EITHER BY THE MULTITUDE OF THE ENEMIES
3654-171138-0038 OR BY THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE PLACES THEY WERE IN NO NOR BY FORTUNE NEITHER FOR THEIR VICTORIES HAVE BEEN SURER TO THEM THAN FORTUNE COULD HAVE GRANTED THEM
3654-171138-0039 IN A CASE THEREFORE WHERE COUNSEL STILL GOES BEFORE ACTION AND WHERE AFTER TAKING THE BEST ADVICE THAT ADVICE IS FOLLOWED BY SO ACTIVE AN ARMY WHAT WONDER IS IT THAT EUPHRATES ON THE EAST THE OCEAN ON THE WEST
3654-171138-0040 THE MOST FERTILE REGIONS OF LIBYA ON THE SOUTH AND THE DANUBE AND THE RHINE ON THE NORTH ARE THE LIMITS OF THIS EMPIRE ONE MIGHT WELL SAY THAT THE ROMAN POSSESSIONS ARE NOT INFERIOR
3654-171138-0041 THIS DISCOURSE OF THE ROMAN MILITARY CONDUCT MAY ALSO PERHAPS BE OF USE TO SUCH OF THE CURIOUS AS ARE IGNORANT OF IT AND YET HAVE A MIND TO KNOW IT I RETURN NOW FROM THIS DIGRESSION
3654-171138-0042 AND HAD PUT HIS ARMY IN ORDER BUT WHEN PLACIDUS WHO HAD OVERRUN GALILEE AND HAD BESIDES SLAIN A NUMBER OF THOSE WHOM HE HAD CAUGHT WHICH WERE ONLY THE WEAKER PART OF THE GALILEANS AND SUCH AS WERE OF TIMOROUS SOULS
3654-171138-0043 AND BRING A GREAT ADVANTAGE TO THEM IN THEIR FUTURE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IF THIS STRONGEST PLACE OF THEM ALL WERE ONCE TAKEN THE REST WOULD BE SO AFFRIGHTED AS TO SURRENDER THEMSELVES BUT HE WAS MIGHTILY MISTAKEN IN HIS UNDERTAKING
3654-171138-0044 AND OF GREAT ALACRITY AS ESTEEMING THEIR COUNTRY THEIR WIVES AND THEIR CHILDREN TO BE IN DANGER AND EASILY PUT THE ROMANS TO FLIGHT AND WOUNDED MANY OF THEM AND SLEW SEVEN OF THEM
3654-171138-0045 BE CAUSE THE STROKES ONLY TOUCHED THE SURFACE OF THEIR BODIES WHICH WERE COVERED WITH THEIR ARMOR IN ALL PARTS
3654-171138-0046 AND BECAUSE THE JEWS DID RATHER THROW THEIR WEAPONS UPON THEM FROM A GREAT DISTANCE THAN VENTURE TO COME HAND TO HAND WITH THEM AND HAD ONLY LIGHT ARMOR ON WHILE THE OTHERS WERE COMPLETELY ARMED HOWEVER THREE MEN OF THE JEWS SIDE WERE SLAIN AND A FEW WOUNDED
3654-171138-0047 HE ORDERED THOSE AUXILIARIES WHICH WERE LIGHTLY ARMED AND THE ARCHERS TO MARCH FIRST THAT THEY MIGHT PREVENT ANY SUDDEN INSULTS FROM THE ENEMY AND MIGHT SEARCH OUT THE WOODS THAT LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY AND WERE CAPABLE OF AMBUSCADES
3654-171138-0048 AND AFTER THEM SUCH AS WERE TO MAKE THE ROAD EVEN AND STRAIGHT AND IF IT WERE ANY WHERE ROUGH AND HARD TO BE PASSED OVER TO PLANE IT AND TO CUT DOWN THE WOODS THAT HINDERED THEIR MARCH THAT THE ARMY MIGHT NOT BE IN DISTRESS OR TIRED WITH THEIR MARCH
3654-171138-0049 NEXT TO THESE CAME THE MULES THAT CARRIED THE ENGINES FOR SIEGES AND THE OTHER WARLIKE MACHINES OF THAT NATURE AFTER THESE CAME THE COMMANDERS OF THE COHORTS AND TRIBUNES HAVING ABOUT THEM SOLDIERS CHOSEN OUT OF THE REST
3654-171138-0050 THEN CAME THE ENSIGNS ENCOMPASSING THE EAGLE WHICH IS AT THE HEAD OF EVERY ROMAN LEGION
3654-171138-0051 WHICH SEEMS TO THEM A SIGNAL OF DOMINION AND AN OMEN THAT THEY SHALL CONQUER ALL AGAINST WHOM THEY MARCH THESE SACRED ENSIGNS ARE FOLLOWED BY THE TRUMPETERS THEN CAME THE MAIN ARMY IN THEIR SQUADRONS AND BATTALIONS
3654-171138-0052 WITH SIX MEN IN DEPTH WHICH WERE FOLLOWED AT LAST BY A CENTURION WHO ACCORDING TO CUSTOM OBSERVED THE REST AS FOR THE SERVANTS OF EVERY LEGION THEY ALL FOLLOWED THE FOOTMEN AND LED THE BAGGAGE OF THE SOLDIERS
3654-171138-0053 WHICH WAS BORNE BY THE MULES AND OTHER BEASTS OF BURDEN
3654-171138-0054 HE ALSO SHOWED HIS ARMY TO THE ENEMY IN ORDER TO AFFRIGHT THEM AND TO AFFORD THEM A SEASON FOR REPENTANCE
3654-171138-0055 AND AT THE SAME TIME HE GOT THINGS READY FOR BESIEGING THEIR STRONG MINDS AND INDEED THIS SIGHT OF THE GENERAL BROUGHT MANY TO REPENT OF THEIR REVOLT AND PUT THEM ALL INTO A CONSTERNATION FOR THOSE THAT WERE IN JOSEPHUS'S CAMP
3654-171138-0056 DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND FLED NOT ONLY BEFORE THEY CAME TO A BATTLE BUT BEFORE THE ENEMY EVER CAME IN SIGHT WHILE JOSEPHUS AND A FEW OTHERS WERE LEFT BEHIND AND AS HE SAW THAT HE HAD NOT AN ARMY SUFFICIENT TO ENGAGE THE ENEMY THAT THE SPIRITS OF THE JEWS WERE SUNK
3654-171138-0057 AND THAT THE GREATER PART WOULD WILLINGLY COME TO TERMS IF THEY MIGHT BE CREDITED HE ALREADY DESPAIRED OF THE SUCCESS OF THE WHOLE WAR AND DETERMINED TO GET AS FAR AS HE POSSIBLY COULD OUT OF DANGER SO HE TOOK THOSE THAT STAID ALONG WITH HIM
