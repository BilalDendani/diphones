5386-8684-0000 IN A TINY COTTAGE NEAR THE KING'S PALACE THERE ONCE LIVED AN OLD MAN HIS WIFE AND HIS SON A VERY LAZY FELLOW WHO WOULD NEVER DO A STROKE OF WORK HE COULD NOT BE GOT EVEN TO LOOK AFTER THEIR ONE COW
5386-8684-0001 BUT LEFT HER TO LOOK AFTER HERSELF WHILE HE LAY ON A BANK AND WENT TO SLEEP IN THE SUN FOR A LONG TIME HIS FATHER BORE WITH HIM HOPING THAT AS HE GREW OLDER HE MIGHT GAIN MORE SENSE BUT AT LAST THE OLD MAN'S PATIENCE WAS WORN OUT
5386-8684-0002 AND MUST GO OUT INTO THE WORLD TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE
5386-8684-0003 AT LENGTH HE CAME TO A LARGE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE KNOCKED WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE OLD MAN WHO OPENED IT AND THE YOUTH TOLD HIM HOW HIS FATHER HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF HIS HOUSE BECAUSE HE WAS SO LAZY AND STUPID AND HE NEEDED SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT
5386-8684-0004 THAT YOU SHALL HAVE REPLIED THE MAN BUT TO MORROW I SHALL GIVE YOU SOME WORK TO DO FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT I AM THE CHIEF HERDSMAN OF THE KING THE YOUTH MADE NO ANSWER TO THIS
5386-8684-0005 BUT AS HE DID NOT SEE ANY OTHER WAY OF GETTING A BED HE WENT SLOWLY IN THE HERDSMAN'S TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR MOTHER WERE SITTING AT SUPPER AND INVITED HIM TO JOIN THEM NOTHING MORE WAS SAID ABOUT WORK AND WHEN THE MEAL WAS OVER THEY ALL WENT TO BED
5386-8684-0006 OH I AM USED TO THAT ANSWERED THE YOUTH YES BUT THIS TIME YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IT PROPERLY SAID THE HERDSMAN AND HE TOOK THE YOUTH TO THE PLACE WHERE THE PIGS WERE FEEDING
5386-8684-0007 ASKED THE OLD MAN IN SURPRISE WHEN HIS SON KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HUT HE HAD LEFT ONLY THE DAY BEFORE THEY BELONG TO THE KING'S CHIEF HERDSMAN ANSWERED HIS SON
5386-8684-0008 NOW MAKE THE BEST OF YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND KILL THEM AND HANG THEM UP AT ONCE
5386-8684-0009 CRIED THE FATHER PALE WITH HORROR WE SHOULD CERTAINLY BOTH BE PUT TO DEATH IF I DID ANY SUCH THING NO NO DO AS I TELL YOU AND I WILL GET OUT OF IT SOMEHOW REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN AND IN THE END HE HAD HIS WAY THE PIGS WERE KILLED AND LAID SIDE BY SIDE IN A ROW
5386-8684-0010 THEN HE CUT OFF THE TAILS AND TIED THEM TOGETHER WITH A PIECE OF CORD AND SWINGING THE BUNDLE OVER HIS BACK HE RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FEEDING
5386-8684-0011 AND FINDING A LARGE STONE HE FASTENED THE ROPE TO IT AND SANK IT IN THE SWAMP AFTER WHICH HE ARRANGED THE TAILS CAREFULLY ONE BY ONE SO THAT ONLY THEIR POINTS WERE SEEN STICKING OUT OF THE WATER WHEN EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER HE HASTENED HOME TO HIS MASTER WITH SUCH A SORROWFUL FACE
5386-8684-0012 WHERE ARE THE PIGS ASKED HE OH DON'T SPEAK OF THEM ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN I REALLY CAN HARDLY TELL YOU THE MOMENT THEY GOT INTO THE FIELD THEY BECAME QUITE MAD AND EACH RAN IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION
5386-8684-0013 I RAN TOO HITHER AND THITHER BUT AS FAST AS I CAUGHT ONE ANOTHER WAS OFF TILL I WAS IN DESPAIR AT LAST HOWEVER I COLLECTED THEM ALL AND WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE THEM BACK WHEN SUDDENLY THEY RUSHED DOWN THE HILL INTO THE SWAMP WHERE THEY VANISHED COMPLETELY
5386-8684-0014 LEAVING ONLY THE POINTS OF THEIR TAILS WHICH YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF YOU HAVE MADE UP THAT STORY VERY WELL REPLIED THE HERDSMAN
5386-8684-0015 AND THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE SPOT
5386-8684-0016 YES YOUR STORY WAS TRUE AFTER ALL IT IS A WONDERFUL THING SAID THE HERDSMAN BUT I SEE IT IS NO FAULT OF YOURS AND I MUST PUT UP WITH MY LOSS AS WELL AS I CAN NOW LET US RETURN HOME FOR IT IS TIME FOR SUPPER NEXT MORNING THE HERDSMAN SAID TO THE YOUNG MAN
5386-8684-0017 TO DAY YOU MUST TAKE A HUNDRED SHEEP TO GRAZE BUT BE CAREFUL THAT NO HARM BEFALLS THEM I WILL DO MY BEST REPLIED THE YOUTH AND HE OPENED THE GATE OF THE FOLD WHERE THE SHEEP HAD BEEN ALL NIGHT AND DROVE THEM OUT INTO THE MEADOW
5386-8684-0018 BUT IN A SHORT TIME THEY GREW AS WILD AS THE PIGS HAD DONE AND SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS THE YOUNG MAN COULD NOT COLLECT THEM TRY AS HE WOULD AND HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT THIS WAS THE PUNISHMENT FOR HIS LAZINESS IN REFUSING TO LOOK AFTER HIS FATHER'S ONE COW
5386-8684-0019 AT LAST HOWEVER THE SHEEP SEEMED TIRED OF RUNNING ABOUT AND THEN THE YOUTH MANAGED TO GATHER THEM TOGETHER AND DROVE THEM AS BEFORE STRAIGHT TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE WHOSE SHEEP ARE THESE AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE ASKED THE OLD MAN IN WONDER AND HIS SON TOLD HIM BUT WHEN THE TALE WAS ENDED THE FATHER SHOOK HIS HEAD
5386-8684-0020 NO NO ANSWERED THE YOUTH I AM NOT SO STUPID AS THAT WE WILL KILL THEM AND HAVE THEM FOR DINNER YOU WILL LOSE YOUR LIFE IF YOU DO REPLIED THE FATHER OH I AM NOT SURE OF THAT SAID THE SON
5386-8684-0021 BUT HE CUT OFF THE HEAD OF THE RAM WHICH ALWAYS LED THE FLOCK AND HAD BELLS ROUND ITS HORNS THIS HE TOOK BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FEEDING FOR HERE HE HAD NOTICED A HIGH ROCK WITH A PATCH OF GREEN GRASS IN THE MIDDLE AND TWO OR THREE THICK BUSHES GROWING ON THE EDGE
5386-8684-0022 UP THIS ROCK HE CLIMBED WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND FASTENED THE RAM'S HEAD TO THE BUSHES WITH A CORD LEAVING ONLY THE TIPS OF THE HORNS WITH THE BELLS VISIBLE AS THERE WAS A SOFT BREEZE BLOWING THE BUSHES TO WHICH THE HEAD WAS TIED MOVED GENTLY AND THE BELLS RANG
5386-8684-0023 WHEN ALL WAS DONE TO HIS LIKING HE HASTENED QUICKLY BACK TO HIS MASTER WHERE ARE THE SHEEP
5386-8684-0024 OH DON'T SPEAK OF THEM ANSWERED HE
5386-8684-0025 IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND I I RAN AFTER THEM AND NEARLY DIED OF FATIGUE THEN I HEARD A A NOISE WHICH I I THOUGHT WAS THE WIND BUT BUT IT WAS THE SHEEP WHICH BE BEFORE MY VERY EYES WERE CARRIED STRAIGHT UP UP INTO THE AIR I STOOD WATCHING THEM AS IF I WAS TURNED TO STONE
5386-8684-0026 THAT IS NOTHING BUT A LIE FROM BEGINNING TO END SAID THE HERDSMAN NO IT IS AS TRUE AS THAT THERE IS A SUN IN HEAVEN ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THEN GIVE ME A PROOF OF IT CRIED HIS MASTER WELL COME WITH ME SAID THE YOUTH
5386-8684-0027 BY THIS TIME IT WAS EVENING AND THE DUSK WAS FALLING THE YOUNG MAN BROUGHT THE HERDSMAN TO THE FOOT OF THE GREAT ROCK
5386-8684-0028 STILL THE SOUND OF SHEEP BELLS RANG SOFTLY FROM ABOVE AND THE HERDSMAN KNEW THEM TO BE THOSE HE HAD HUNG ON THE HORNS OF HIS RAM DO YOU HEAR ASKED THE YOUTH YES I HEAR
5386-8684-0029 BUT TO DAY I HAVE SOMETHING QUITE EASY FOR YOU TO DO YOU MUST LOOK AFTER FORTY OXEN AND BE SURE YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL FOR ONE OF THEM HAS GOLD TIPPED HORNS AND HOOFS AND THE KING RECKONS IT AMONG HIS GREATEST TREASURES THE YOUNG MAN DROVE OUT THE OXEN INTO THE MEADOW
5386-8684-0030 WITH HIS SON AND HIS OWN COW AT THEIR HEAD WHOSE CATTLE ARE THESE AND WHY ARE THEY HERE HE ASKED AND HIS SON TOLD HIM THE STORY
5386-8684-0031 BUT THE SON ONLY LAUGHED AND SAID NO NO
5386-8684-0032 FOR A LONG WHILE THE OLD MAN REFUSED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH SUCH A WICKED SCHEME BUT HIS SON TALKED HIM OVER IN THE END AND THEY KILLED THE OXEN AS THEY HAD KILLED THE SHEEP AND THE PIGS LAST OF ALL THEY CAME TO THE KING'S CHERISHED OX
5386-8684-0033 THE SON HAD A ROPE READY TO CAST ROUND ITS HORNS AND THROW IT TO THE GROUND BUT THE OX WAS STRONGER THAN THE ROPE AND SOON TORE IT IN PIECES THEN IT DASHED AWAY TO THE WOOD THE YOUTH FOLLOWING OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES THEY BOTH WENT TILL THEY REACHED THE ROCKY PASS WHICH BORDERED THE HERDSMAN'S LAND
5386-8684-0034 THEN THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING RAN HOME TO HIS MASTER
5386-8684-0035 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HEARD SOUNDS OF BELLOWING AND I THOUGHT I RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF THE GOLDEN HORNED OX BUT WHEN I GOT TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THE SOUNDS HAD COME I COULD NEITHER SEE NOR HEAR ANYTHING IN THE HOLE ITSELF
5386-8684-0036 WONDER UPON WONDER HE EXCLAIMED SO YOU REALLY DID SPEAK THE TRUTH AFTER ALL WELL I CANNOT REPROACH YOU THOUGH I SHALL HAVE TO PAY HEAVILY TO MY ROYAL MASTER FOR THE VALUE OF THAT OX BUT COME LET US GO HOME I WILL NEVER SET YOU TO HERD CATTLE AGAIN HENCEFORWARD I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING EASIER TO DO
5386-8684-0037 I HAVE THOUGHT OF EXACTLY THE THING FOR YOU SAID THE HERDSMAN AS THEY WALKED ALONG AND IT IS SO SIMPLE THAT YOU CANNOT MAKE A MISTAKE
5386-8684-0038 FOR I WANT THE GRASS MOWN IN ONE OF MY MEADOWS TO MORROW AT THESE WORDS THE YOUTH'S HEART SANK FOR HE HAD NEVER BEEN TRAINED EITHER AS A SMITH OR A JOINER
5386-8684-0039 SLOWLY AND SADLY HE WENT TO BED BUT HE COULD NOT SLEEP FOR WONDERING HOW THE SCYTHES WERE TO BE MADE
5386-8684-0040 SO LISTENING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL WAS STILL HE STOLE AWAY TO HIS PARENTS AND TOLD THEM THE WHOLE STORY WHEN THEY HAD HEARD EVERYTHING THEY HID HIM WHERE NO ONE COULD FIND HIM TIME PASSED AWAY AND THE YOUNG MAN STAYED AT HOME DOING ALL HIS PARENTS BADE HIM
5386-8684-0041 AND SHOWING HIMSELF VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE HAD BEEN BEFORE HE WENT OUT TO SEE THE WORLD BUT ONE DAY HE SAID TO HIS FATHER THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO MARRY AND HAVE A HOUSE OF HIS OWN WHEN I SERVED THE KING'S CHIEF HERDSMAN ADDED HE I SAW HIS DAUGHTER AND I AM RESOLVED TO TRY IF I CANNOT WIN HER FOR MY WIFE
5386-8684-0042 IT WILL COST YOU YOUR LIFE IF YOU DO ANSWERED THE FATHER SHAKING HIS HEAD WELL I WILL DO MY BEST REPLIED HIS SON BUT FIRST GIVE ME THE SWORD WHICH HANGS OVER YOUR BED
5386-8684-0043 LATE IN THE EVENING HE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE HERDSMAN AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WHICH WAS OPENED BY A LITTLE BOY
5386-8684-0044 SO IT IS YOU CRIED THE HERDSMAN WHEN HE HAD RECEIVED THE MESSAGE
5386-8684-0045 THEN THE YOUNG MAN WENT HOME TO HIS PARENTS AND BADE THEM GET READY TO WELCOME HIS BRIDE AND WHEN THE WEDDING WAS OVER HE TOLD HIS FATHER IN LAW THE HERDSMAN WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH THE SHEEP AND PIGS AND CATTLE BY AND BY THE STORY CAME TO THE KING'S EARS
5386-8684-0046 AND HE THOUGHT THAT A MAN WHO WAS SO CLEVER WAS JUST THE MAN TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY
