7376-96150-0000 I HAVE FORGOTTEN YET FOUR YEARS AGO IT WAS FAMILIAR TO ME AS MY OWN NAME THINGS WHICH TOOK PLACE BEFORE THE VOYAGE SEEM TO BE GETTING A LITTLE CLOUDY IN THE MEMORY NOW I HAVE SAT HERE
7376-96150-0001 TO WRITE DOWN SOME SORT OF ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED GOD KNOWS WHY SINCE NO EYE CAN EVER READ IT AND AT THE VERY BEGINNING I CANNOT REMEMBER THE PARSON'S NAME
7376-96150-0002 A SCOTCHMAN FROM AYRSHIRE BIG AND GAUNT WITH TAWNY HAIR HE USED TO GO ABOUT LONDON STREETS IN SHOUGH AND ROUGH SPUN CLOTHES A PLAID FLUNG FROM ONE SHOULDER ONCE I SAW HIM IN HOLBORN WITH HIS RATHER WILD STALK
7376-96150-0003 FROWNING AND MUTTERING TO HIMSELF HE HAD NO SOONER COME TO LONDON AND OPENED CHAPEL I THINK IN FETTER LANE THAN THE LITTLE ROOM BEGAN TO BE CROWDED AND WHEN SOME YEARS AFTERWARDS
7376-96150-0004 HIS VOICE FROM A WHISPER RAN GATHERING LIKE SNOW BALLS AND CRASHED AS I HAVE HEARD THE PACK ICE IN COMMOTION FAR YONDER IN THE NORTH WHILE HIS GESTURES WERE AS UNCOUTH AND GAWKY
7376-96150-0005 AS SOME WILD MAN'S OF THE PRIMITIVE AGES WELL THIS MAN WHAT WAS HIS NAME MACINTOSH MACKAY I THINK YES THAT WAS IT MACKAY
7376-96150-0006 MACKAY SAW FIT TO TAKE OFFENCE AT THE NEW ATTEMPT TO REACH THE POLE IN THE BOREAL AND FOR THREE SUNDAYS WHEN THE PREPARATIONS WERE NEARING COMPLETION STORMED AGAINST IT AT KENSINGTON
7376-96150-0007 THE EXCITEMENT OF THE WORLD WITH REGARD TO THE NORTH POLE HAD AT THIS DATE REACHED A PITCH WHICH CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS FEVERED THOUGH THAT WORD HARDLY EXPRESSES THE STRANGE ECSTASY AND UNREST WHICH PREVAILED
7376-96150-0008 FOR THE ABSTRACT INTEREST WHICH MANKIND IN MERE DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE HAD ALWAYS FELT IN THIS UNKNOWN REGION WAS NOW SUDDENLY A THOUSAND AND A THOUSAND TIMES INTENSIFIED
7376-96150-0009 BY A NEW CONCRETE INTEREST A TREMENDOUS MONEY INTEREST AND THE NEW ZEAL HAD CEASED TO BE HEALTHY IN ITS TONE AS THE OLD ZEAL WAS
7376-96150-0010 THE SECRET OF THIS NEW RAGE LAY IN THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF MISTER CHARLES P STICKNEY OF CHICAGO
7376-96150-0011 AND FROM THIS LOOSE METHOD OF DESIGNATING THE PERSON INTENDED HAD IMMEDIATELY BURST FORTH A PROLONGED HEAT OF CONTROVERSY IN EUROPE AND AMERICA AS TO WHETHER OR NO THE TESTATOR MEANT THE CHIEF
7376-96150-0012 WHATEVER HIS STATION IN THE EXPEDITION WHOSE FOOT FIRST REACHED THE NINETIETH DEGREE OF NORTH LATITUDE
7376-96150-0013 EVERYONE WAS AN AUTHORITY ON HER FITTING AND SHE WAS IN EVERY MOUTH A BET A HOPE A JEST OR A SNEER FOR NOW AT LAST IT WAS FELT THAT SUCCESS WAS PROBABLE
7376-96150-0014 AND WITHOUT DOUBT HE DID SUGGEST SOMETHING OF THAT SORT I SUPPOSE THAT AT THE TIME WHEN HE HAD THE FACE TO DENOUNCE THE BOREAL THERE WAS NOT A SOVEREIGN ON ANY THRONE IN EUROPE WHO
7376-96150-0015 BUT FOR SHAME WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD OF A SUBORDINATE POST ON BOARD ON THE THIRD SUNDAY NIGHT OF HIS DENUNCIATION I WAS THERE IN THAT KENSINGTON CHAPEL AND I HEARD HIM
7376-96150-0016 AND THE WILD TALK HE TALKED HE SEEMED LIKE A MAN DELIRIOUS WITH INSPIRATION THE PEOPLE SAT QUITE SPELL BOUND WHILE MACKAY'S PROPHESYING VOICE RANGED UP AND DOWN THROUGH ALL THE MODULATIONS OF THUNDER
7376-96150-0017 FROM THE HURRYING MUTTER TO THE REVERBERANT SHOCK AND CLIMAX AND THOSE WHO CAME TO SCOFF REMAINED TO WONDER PUT SIMPLY
7376-96150-0018 THE NORTH POLE HE SAID WAS NOT SO VERY FAR AWAY AND THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF REACHING IT WERE NOT ON THE FACE OF THEM SO VERY GREAT
7376-96150-0019 HUMAN INGENUITY HAD ACHIEVED A THOUSAND THINGS A THOUSAND TIMES MORE DIFFICULT YET IN SPITE OF OVER HALF A DOZEN WELL PLANNED EFFORTS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
7376-96150-0020 AND THIRTY ONE IN THE TWENTIETH MAN HAD NEVER REACHED ALWAYS HE HAD BEEN BAULKED
7376-96150-0021 WONDERFULLY REALLY WONDERFULLY LIKE THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE IN EDEN HE SAID WAS THAT POLE
7376-96150-0022 PERSISTENTLY VEILED AND FORBIDDEN
7376-96150-0023 AND HE BELIEVED HE SAID THAT THE TIME WAS NOW COME WHEN MAN WOULD FIND IT ABSOLUTELY IN HIS POWER TO STAND ON THAT NINETIETH OF LATITUDE AND PLANT AN IMPIOUS RIGHT FOOT ON THE HEAD OF THE EARTH
7376-96150-0024 JUST AS IT HAD BEEN GIVEN INTO THE ABSOLUTE POWER OF ADAM TO STRETCH AN IMPIOUS RIGHT HAND AND PLUCK OF THE FRUIT OF KNOWLEDGE
7376-96150-0025 THE MAN'S FRANTIC EARNESTNESS AUTHORITATIVE VOICE AND SAVAGE GESTURES COULD NOT BUT HAVE THEIR EFFECT UPON ALL AS FOR ME I DECLARE I SAT AS THOUGH A MESSENGER FROM HEAVEN ADDRESSED ME
7376-96150-0026 BUT I BELIEVE THAT I HAD NOT YET REACHED HOME
7376-96150-0027 HE IS BEHIND HIS AGE I SUPPOSE BUT HAVEN'T I THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY OF MACKAY SINCE MY GOD THREE WEEKS IT WAS ABOUT THAT BEFORE THAT SUNDAY NIGHT DISCOURSE I WAS VISITED BY CLARK
7376-96150-0028 THE CHIEF OF THE COMING EXPEDITION A MERE VISIT OF FRIENDSHIP
7376-96150-0029 AND THOUGH UNDER TWENTY FIVE HAD I SUPPOSE AS ELITE A PRACTICE AS ANY DOCTOR IN EUROPE ELITE BUT SMALL I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN MY STATE AND MOVE AMONG THE GREAT
7376-96150-0030 IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION THAT AFTERNOON CLARK SAID TO ME IN HIS LIGHT HAP HAZARD WAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DREAMED ABOUT YOU LAST NIGHT ADAM JEFFSON I DREAMED THAT YOU WERE WITH US ON THE EXPEDITION I THINK HE MUST HAVE SEEN MY START
7376-96150-0031 ON THE SAME NIGHT I HAD MYSELF DREAMED THE SAME THING BUT NOT A WORD SAID I ABOUT IT NOW THERE WAS A STAMMER IN MY TONGUE WHEN I ANSWERED WHO I ON THE EXPEDITION I WOULD NOT GO IF I WERE ASKED
7376-96150-0032 WELL WE NEED NOT DISCUSS THE POINT
7376-96150-0033 I KNOW REALLY VERY LITTLE OF ASTRONOMY OR MAGNETIC PHENOMENA BESIDES I AM ABOUT TO BE MARRIED BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOTANY MY FRIEND
7376-96150-0034 AND AS FOR NAUTICAL ASTRONOMY POH
7376-96150-0035 I SAID SMILING SUCH A THOUGHT WOULD NEVER ENTER MY HEAD THERE IS FIRST OF ALL MY FIANCEE AH THE ALL IMPORTANT COUNTESS EH
7376-96150-0036 THE CHANCE OF STAMPING ONE'S FOOT ON THE NORTH POLE DOES NOT OCCUR TO A MAN EVERY DAY MY SON DO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE I SAID THERE IS PETERS WELL OF COURSE THERE IS PETERS BUT BELIEVE ME THE DREAM I HAD WAS SO CLEAR
7376-96150-0037 HAS MADE IT THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WHICH ANY CREATURE OF EARTH EVER LIVED AND I KNEW THAT THIS WAS SO FIRSTLY BECAUSE OF THE TWO DREAMS AND SECONDLY
7376-96150-0038 AN ORDINARY PERSON READING MY WORDS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY IMAGINE THAT I MEAN ONLY TWO ORDINARY CONTRADICTORY IMPULSES OR ELSE THAT I RAVE FOR WHAT MODERN MAN COULD COMPREHEND HOW REAL SEEMING WERE THOSE VOICES
7376-96150-0039 HOW LOUD AND HOW EVER AND AGAIN I HEARD THEM CONTEND WITHIN ME WITH A NEARNESS
7376-96150-0040 I WAS PLAYING ONE SUMMER EVENING IN A PINE WOOD OF MY FATHER'S HALF A MILE AWAY WAS A QUARRY CLIFF AND AS I PLAYED IT SUDDENLY SEEMED AS IF SOMEONE SAID TO ME INSIDE OF ME JUST TAKE A WALK TOWARD THE CLIFF AND AS IF SOMEONE ELSE SAID
7376-96150-0041 DON'T GO THAT WAY AT ALL' MERE WHISPERS THEN WHICH GRADUALLY AS I GREW UP SEEMED TO SWELL INTO CRIES OF WRATHFUL CONTENTION I DID GO TOWARD THE CLIFF IT WAS STEEP THIRTY FEET HIGH
7376-96150-0042 AND I FELL SOME WEEKS LATER ON RECOVERING SPEECH I TOLD MY ASTONISHED MOTHER THAT SOMEONE HAD PUSHED ME OVER THE EDGE AND THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAD CAUGHT ME AT THE BOTTOM
7376-96150-0043 THAT TWO POWERS WHICH HATED EACH OTHER MUST BE CONTINUALLY AFTER ME ONE WISHING FOR SOME REASON TO KILL ME AND THE OTHER FOR SOME REASON TO KEEP ME ALIVE ONE WISHING ME TO DO SO AND SO
7376-96150-0044 BUT A CREATURE SEPARATE SPECIAL MARKED FOR SOMETHING ALREADY I HAD NOTIONS TOUCHES OF MOOD PASSING INSTINCTS
7376-96150-0045 HAVE HARDLY EVER SUGGESTED ANY QUESTION IN MY MIND AS TO HOW THE VOICE WAS HEARD I DID NOT FIND IT SO VERY DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND THAT ORIGINALLY MAN HAD MORE EARS THAN TWO
7376-96150-0046 MORE OR LESS RESEMBLED THOSE PRIMEVAL ONES BUT NOT A CREATURE EXCEPT PERHAPS MY MOTHER HAS EVER DREAMED ME WHAT I HERE STATE THAT I WAS I SEEMED THE ORDINARY YOUTH OF MY TIME BOW IN MY VARSITY EIGHT
7376-96150-0047 CRAMMING FOR EXAMS DAWDLING IN CLUBS WHEN I HAD TO DECIDE AS TO A PROFESSION WHO COULD HAVE SUSPECTED THE CONFLICT THAT TRANSACTED ITSELF IN MY SOUL WHILE MY BRAIN WAS INDIFFERENT TO THE MATTER
7376-96150-0048 THAT AGONY OF STRIFE WITH WHICH THE BRAWLING VOICES SHOUTED THE ONE BE A SCIENTIST A DOCTOR AND THE OTHER BE A LAWYER AN ENGINEER AN ARTIST BE ANYTHING BUT A DOCTOR A DOCTOR I BECAME
7376-96150-0049 AND WENT TO WHAT HAD GROWN INTO THE GREATEST OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS CAMBRIDGE AND THERE IT WAS THAT I CAME ACROSS A MAN NAMED SCOTLAND WHO HAD A RATHER ODD VIEW OF THE WORLD HE HAD ROOMS I REMEMBER IN THE NEW COURT AT TRINITY
7376-96150-0050 AND A SET OF US WERE GENERALLY THERE HE WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN BLACK AND WHITE POWERS TILL IT BECAME ABSURD AND THE MEN USED TO CALL HIM BLACK AND WHITE MYSTERY MAN
