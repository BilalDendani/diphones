2021-246946-0000 AT FIRST I WAS MORE AFRAID OF THAT THAN OF ANYTHING ELSE THEN AFTER THAT DANGER SEEMED PAST I WAS AFRAID OF THE LIFE TO COME THAT FEAR LEFT ME NEXT AND NOW IT IS THE THING ITSELF THAT IS ALWAYS HAUNTING ME
2021-246946-0001 I OFTEN WISH THEY WOULD COME AND TAKE ME AND DELIVER ME FROM MYSELF IT WOULD BE A COMFORT TO HAVE IT ALL KNOWN AND NEVER NEED TO START AGAIN
2021-246946-0002 IF IT WOULD ANNIHILATE THE DEED OR BRING EMMELINE BACK I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW GLADLY I WOULD BE HANGED I WOULD INDEED MISTER WINGFOLD I I HOPE YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THOUGH I DON'T DESERVE IT
2021-246946-0003 I DO BELIEVE YOU SAID THE CURATE AND A SILENCE FOLLOWED THERE IS BUT ONE THING I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE AT THIS MOMENT HE RESUMED IT IS THAT I AM YOUR FRIEND AND WILL STAND BY YOU
2021-246946-0004 BUT THE FIRST PART OF FRIENDSHIP SOMETIMES IS TO CONFESS POVERTY AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT OF THE VERY THINGS CONCERNING WHICH I OUGHT TO KNOW MOST I KNEW LEAST I HAVE BUT LATELY BEGUN TO FEEL AFTER GOD
2021-246946-0005 THAT SO TOGETHER WE MAY WAIT FOR WHAT LIGHT MAY COME DOES ANYTHING EVER LOOK TO YOU AS IF IT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER
2021-246946-0006 OR TAKE COMFORT FROM ANYTHING I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THAT
2021-246946-0007 AND IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU THINK LESS OF YOUR CRIME NO IT MAKES ME FEEL IT WORSE THAN EVER TO SEE YOU SITTING THERE A CLEAN STRONG INNOCENT MAN AND THINK WHAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
2021-246946-0008 THEN THE COMFORT YOU GET FROM ME DOES YOU NO HARM AT LEAST IF I WERE TO FIND MY COMPANY MADE YOU THINK WITH LESS HATRED OF YOUR CRIME I SHOULD GO AWAY THAT INSTANT THANK YOU SIR SAID LEOPOLD HUMBLY
2021-246946-0009 OH SIR HE RESUMED AFTER A LITTLE SILENCE TO THINK THAT NEVER MORE TO ALL ETERNITY SHALL I BE ABLE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS I USED TO THINK PERHAPS YOU USED TO THINK TOO MUCH OF YOURSELF RETURNED THE CURATE
2021-246946-0010 FOR THE GREATEST FOOL AND RASCAL IN CREATION THERE IS YET A WORSE CONDITION AND THAT IS NOT TO KNOW IT BUT THINK HIMSELF A RESPECTABLE MAN AS THE EVENT PROVES THOUGH YOU WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE LAUGHED AT THE IDEA
2021-246946-0011 I HAVE COME TO SEE AT LEAST I THINK I HAVE THAT EXCEPT A MAN HAS GOD DWELLING IN HIM HE MAY BE OR MAY BECOME CAPABLE OF ANY CRIME WITHIN THE COMPASS OF HUMAN NATURE
2021-246946-0012 I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GOD SAID LEOPOLD I DARESAY I THOUGHT I DID BEFORE THIS HAPPENED BEFORE I DID IT I MEAN HE ADDED IN CORRECTION BUT I KNOW NOW THAT I DON'T AND NEVER DID
2021-246946-0013 AH LEOPOLD SAID THE CURATE THINK IF MY COMING TO YOU COMFORTS YOU WHAT WOULD IT BE TO HAVE HIM WHO MADE YOU ALWAYS WITH YOU WHERE WOULD BE THE GOOD I DARESAY HE MIGHT FORGIVE ME
2021-246946-0014 BUT WHERE WOULD BE THE GOOD OF IT IT WOULD NOT TAKE THE THING OFF ME ONE BIT AH NOW SAID WINGFOLD I FEAR YOU ARE THINKING A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR OWN DISGRACE AND NOT ONLY OF THE BAD YOU HAVE DONE
2021-246946-0015 WHY SHOULD YOU NOT BE ASHAMED WHY WOULD YOU HAVE THE SHAME TAKEN OFF YOU NAY YOU MUST HUMBLY CONSENT TO BEAR IT PERHAPS YOUR SHAME IS THE HAND OF LOVE WASHING THE DEFILEMENT FROM OFF YOU
2021-246946-0016 IS IT NOT RATHER TO HAVE THAT IN YOU A PART OR ALL BUT A PART OF YOUR BEING THAT MAKES YOU CAPABLE OF DOING IT IF YOU HAD RESISTED AND CONQUERED
2021-246946-0017 AND NOW IF YOU REPENT AND GOD COMES TO YOU YOU WILL YET BE CLEAN AGAIN I SAY LET US KEEP OUR SHAME AND BE MADE CLEAN
2021-246946-0018 THOUGH A MEAN PRIDE PERSUADES MEN SO ON THE CONTRARY THE MAN WHO IS HONESTLY ASHAMED HAS BEGUN TO BE CLEAN
2021-246946-0019 BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT DO TO EMMELINE IT CANNOT BRING HER UP AGAIN TO THE BRIGHT WORLD OUT OF THE DARK GRAVE EMMELINE IS NOT IN THE DARK GRAVE WHERE IS SHE THEN
2021-246946-0020 HE SAID WITH A GHASTLY LOOK THAT I CANNOT TELL I ONLY KNOW THAT IF THERE BE A GOD SHE IS IN HIS HANDS REPLIED THE CURATE
2021-246946-0021 WINGFOLD SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN WRONG IN TRYING TO COMFORT HIM WITH THE THOUGHT OF GOD DWELLING IN HIM HOW WAS SUCH A POOR PASSIONATE CREATURE TO TAKE THAT FOR A COMFORT HOW WAS HE TO UNDERSTAND OR PRIZE THE IDEA
2021-246946-0022 WHO HAD HIS SPIRITUAL NATURE SO ALL UNDEVELOPED HE WOULD TRY ANOTHER WAY SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT SEEMS TO ME SOMETIMES THE ONLY ONE THING I WANT TO HELP ME OUT OF MY DIFFICULTIES
2021-246946-0023 YES PLEASE SIR ANSWERED LEOPOLD AS HUMBLY AS A CHILD I THINK SOMETIMES IF I COULD BUT SEE JESUS FOR ONE MOMENT AH CRIED LEOPOLD AND GAVE A GREAT SIGH
2021-246946-0024 YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM THEN WOULD YOU OH MISTER WINGFOLD WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM IF YOU SAW HIM I DON'T KNOW I WOULD FALL DOWN ON MY FACE AND HOLD HIS FEET LEST HE SHOULD GO AWAY FROM ME
2021-246946-0025 HE COULD DESTROY WHAT I HAVE DONE BUT STILL AS YOU SAY THE CRIME WOULD REMAIN BUT AS YOU SAY HE COULD PARDON THAT AND MAKE ME
2021-246946-0026 SO YOU THINK THE STORY ABOUT JESUS CHRIST IS TRUE
2021-246946-0027 COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST IT IS REST YOU WANT MY POOR BOY NOT DELIVERANCE FROM DANGER OR SHAME BUT REST
2021-246946-0028 DO NOT WASTE TIME IN ASKING YOURSELF HOW HE CAN DO IT THAT IS FOR HIM TO UNDERSTAND NOT YOU UNTIL IT IS DONE ASK HIM TO FORGIVE YOU AND MAKE YOU CLEAN AND SET THINGS RIGHT FOR YOU
2021-246946-0029 IF HE WILL NOT DO IT THEN HE IS NOT THE SAVIOUR OF MEN AND WAS WRONGLY NAMED JESUS THE CURATE ROSE LEOPOLD
