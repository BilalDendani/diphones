6482-289558-0000 A SUDDEN BRIGHT FLASH LIGHTED UP THE CAMP THROWING THE LITTLE WHITE TENTS INTO HOLD RELIEF AGAINST THE SOMBRE BACKGROUND OF THE MOUNTAINS IT WAS FOLLOWED AFTER AN INTERVAL BY A LOW RUMBLE OF DISTANT THUNDER THAT BUFFETED ITSELF FROM PEAK TO PEAK OF THE ROCKIES
6482-289558-0001 THE PONY RIDERS STIRRED RESTLESSLY ON THEIR COTS AND TUCKED THE BLANKETS UP UNDER THEIR CHINS CLOSE UPON THE FIRST REPORT FOLLOWED ANOTHER AND LOUDER ONE THAT SENT A DISTINCT TREMOR THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN
6482-289558-0002 GO TO SLEEP YET INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING HIS OWN ADVICE TAD LAY WITH WIDE OPEN EYES AWAITING THE MOMENT WHEN THE STORM SHOULD DESCEND UPON THEIR CAMP IN FULL FORCE HE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT
6482-289558-0003 AS HE CRAWLED FURTHER DOWN UNDER THE BLANKET TO SHUT OUT THE GLARE OF THE LIGHTNING
6482-289558-0004 EACH FLASH APPEARED TO LIGHT UP THE MOUNTAINS FOR MILES AROUND THEIR CRESTS LYING DARK AND FORBIDDING PILED TIER UPON TIER THE BLUE MENACING FLASHES HOVERING ABOUT THEM MOMENTARILY
6482-289558-0005 THEN FADING AWAY IN THE IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS THE CAMP APPEARED TO BE WRAPPED IN SLEEP AND BY THE BRIGHT FLASHES TAD OBSERVED THAT THE BURROS OF THE PACK TRAIN WERE STRETCHED OUT SOUND ASLEEP WHILE OFF IN THE BUSHES HE COULD HEAR THE RESTLESS MOVING ABOUT OF THE PONIES
6482-289558-0006 IN THE CITY OF PUEBLO THEY FOUND THAT ALL PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN MADE BY LIGE THOMAS THE MOUNTAIN GUIDE WHOM MISTER PERKINS HAD ENGAGED TO ACCOMPANY THEM BESIDES THE FOUR PONIES OF THE BOYS THERE WERE THE PROFESSOR'S COB
6482-289558-0007 THOMAS'S PONY AND A PACK TRAIN CONSISTING OF SIX BURROS THE LATTER IN CHARGE OF JOSE
6482-289558-0008 A HALF BREED MEXICAN WHO WAS TO COOK FOR THE PARTY DURING THEIR STAY IN THE MOUNTAINS IT WAS A BRAVE AND JOYOUS BAND THAT HAD SET OUT FROM THE COLORADO CITY IN KHAKI TROUSERS BLUE SHIRTS AND BROAD BRIMMED SOMBREROS FOR AN OUTING OVER THE WILDEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN RANGES
6482-289558-0009 BY THIS TIME THE BOYS HAD LEARNED TO PITCH AND STRIKE CAMP IN THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE TIME IN SHORT TO TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF THEMSELVES UNDER MOST OF THE VARYING CONDITIONS WHICH SUCH A LIFE AS THEY WERE LEADING ENTAILED
6482-289558-0010 WHERE HE THOUGHT HE HAD OBSERVED SOMETHING THAT DID NOT BELONG THERE HUMPH I MUST BE IMAGINING THINGS TONIGHT HE MUTTERED WHEN AFTER THREE OR FOUR ILLUMINATIONS HE HAD DISCOVERED NOTHING FURTHER TAD WAS ABOUT TO RETURN TO HIS COT WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS ONCE MORE ATTRACTED TO THE SPOT
6482-289558-0011 AND WHAT HE SAW THIS TIME THRILLED HIM THROUGH AND THROUGH A MAN WAS CAUTIOUSLY LEADING TWO OF THE PONIES FROM CAMP JUST BACK OF PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN'S TENT THE BOY PAUSED WITH ONE HAND RAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD PREPARED TO PULL THE TENT FLAP QUICKLY BACK IN PLACE
6482-289558-0012 IN CASE THE STRANGER CHANCED TO GLANCE THAT WAY ALL THE WHILE GAZING AT THE MAN WITH UNBELIEVING EYES WAS HE DREAMING TAD WONDERED PINCHING HIMSELF TO MAKE SURE THAT HE REALLY WAS AWAKE ONCE MORE IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS SETTLED OVER THE SCENE
6482-289558-0013 AND WHEN THE NEXT FLASH CAME THE CAMP HAD RESUMED ITS FORMER APPEARANCE TAD BUTLER HESITATED ONLY FOR THE BRIEFEST INSTANT AHOY THE CAMP HE SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SPRINGING OUT INTO THE OPEN WAKE UP WAKE UP
6482-289558-0014 AS IF TO ACCENTUATE HIS ALARM A TWISTING GUST OF WIND SWOOPED DOWN UPON THE WHITE VILLAGE ACCOMPANIED BY THE SOUND OF BREAKING ROPES AND RIPPING CANVAS THE TENT THAT HAD COVERED PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN WAS WRENCHED LOOSE IT SHOT UP INTO THE AIR DISAPPEARING OVER A CLIFF
6482-289558-0015 NOW THE LIGHTNING FLASHES WERE INCESSANT AND THE THUNDER HAD BECOME ONE CONTINUOUS DEAFENING ROAR STOICAL AS HE WAS THE PROFESSOR THUS RUDELY AWAKENED UTTERED A YELL AND LEAPED FROM HIS COT WHILE THE BOYS OF THE PARTY CAME TUMBLING FROM THEIR BLANKETS
6482-289558-0016 RUBBING THEIR EYES AND DEMANDING IN CONFUSED SHOUTS TO KNOW WHAT THE ROW WAS ABOUT BUT LIGE EXPERIENCED MOUNTAINEER THAT HE WAS
6482-289558-0017 INSTINCTIVELY DIVINED THE CAUSE OF THE UPROAR WHEN EMERGING FROM HIS TENT HE SAW TAD DARTING AT TOP SPEED ACROSS THE CAMP GROUND THE PONIES THE PONIES SHOUTED THE BOY AS HE DISAPPEARED IN THE BUSHES REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS CLAD ONLY IN HIS PAJAMAS
6482-289558-0018 WAS THE STARTLING ANNOUNCEMENT THROWN BACK TO THEM BY THE FRECKLE FACED BOY BY THIS TIME THE ENTIRE CAMP WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN AND STACY BROWN HAD SET OUT ON A SWIFT RUN FOLLOWING ON THE TRAIL OF TAD
6482-289558-0019 AHEAD OF HIM THE BOY COULD HEAR THE PONIES HOOFS ON THE ROCKS AND NOW AND THEN A DISTANT CRASH TOLD HIM THEY WERE WORKING UP INTO THE DENSE SECOND GROWTH THAT HE HAD SEEN IN HIS BRIEF TOUR OF INSPECTION EARLIER IN THE EVENING HE REALIZED FROM THE SOUND THAT HE WAS SLOWLY GAINING ON THE MISSING ANIMALS
6482-289558-0020 TAD'S BLOOD WAS UP HIS FIRM JAW ASSUMED THE SET LOOK THAT IT HAD SHOWN WHEN HE WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP WRESTLING MATCH AT THE HIGH SCHOOL THE SHOUTS OF THE OTHERS AT HIS REAR WARNING HIM OF THE DANGER AND CALLING UPON HIM TO RETURN FELL UPON UNHEEDING EARS
6482-289558-0021 SO INTENT WAS THE BOY UPON THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS PURPOSE THAT HE GAVE NO HEED TO THE FACT THAT THE SOUNDS AHEAD HAD CEASED AND THAT ONLY THE SOFT PATTER OF HIS OWN FEET ON THE ROCKS BROKE THE STILLNESS BETWEEN THE LOUD CLAPS OF THUNDER
6482-289558-0022 YET EVEN IF TAD HAD SENSED THIS ITS MEANING
6482-289558-0023 UNUSED AS HE WAS TO THE METHODS OF MOUNTAINEERS SO THE BOY RAN BLINDLY ON IN BRAVE PURSUIT OF THE MAN WHO HAD STOLEN THEIR MOUNTS WHILE THE PONY RIDERS SLEPT SUDDENLY WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST WARNING TAD FELT HIMSELF ENCIRCLED BY A PAIR OF POWERFUL ARMS
6482-289558-0024 ALL HIS FACULTIES WERE INSTANTLY ON THE ALERT BUT HE REALIZED NOW THAT HIS ONLY HOPE LAY IN ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF THE OTHERS OF HIS PARTY
6482-289558-0025 TAD'S SHRILL VOICE PUNCTUATED A MOMENTARY LULL IN THE STORM COMING ANSWERED THE VOICE OF THE GUIDE ITS STRIDENT TONES CARRYING CLEARLY TO TAD
6482-289558-0026 FILLING HIM WITH A FEELING AS NEAR AKIN TO JOY AS WAS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH A SNARL OF RAGE THE BOY'S CAPTOR SUDDENLY RELEASED HIS HOLD AROUND THE WAIST AND GRASPED TAD QUICKLY BY THE KNEES
6482-289558-0027 SO SKILFULLY HAD THE MOVE BEEN EXECUTED THAT TAD BUTLER FOUND HIMSELF DANGLING HEAD DOWN BEFORE HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAD OCCURRED HIS HEAD WAS WHIRLING DIZZILY HE FELT HIS BODY SWAYING FROM SIDE TO SIDE
6482-289558-0028 HIS HEAD DESCRIBING AN ARC OF A CIRCLE AS HE WAS RAPIDLY BEING SWUNG TO AND FRO
6482-289558-0029 TAD KNEW THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HURRY IF THEY WERE TO SAVE HIM FOR AS SOON AS THE DIZZY SWINGING OF HIS BODY BEGAN HE HAD UNDERSTOOD THE PURPOSE OF HIS CAPTOR AT ANY SECOND THE BOY MIGHT FIND HIMSELF FLYING THROUGH SPACE
6482-289558-0030 PERHAPS OVER A PRECIPICE IT PLAINLY WAS THE INTENT OF THE MAN TO HURL THE BOY FAR FROM HIM AS SOON AS TAD'S BODY SHOULD HAVE ATTAINED SUFFICIENT MOMENTUM TO CARRY IT HOWEVER BEFORE THE FELLOW WAS ABLE TO PUT HIS DESPERATE PLAN FULLY INTO EXECUTION
6482-289558-0031 AS HIS BODY SWUNG BY THAT OF HIS CAPTOR THE BOY THREW OUT HIS HANDS CLASPING THEM ABOUT THE LEFT LEG OF THE OTHER AND INSTANTLY LOCKING HIS FINGERS IT SEEMED AS IF THE JOLT WOULD WRENCH HIS ARMS FROM THEIR SOCKETS YET TAD HELD ON DESPERATELY
6482-289558-0032 AND THE RESULT THOUGH WHOLLY UNEXPECTED BY THE MOUNTAINEER WAS NOT ENTIRELY SO TO TAD HE HAD FIGURED HAD HOPED THAT A CERTAIN THING MIGHT OCCUR AND IT DID
6482-289558-0033 THE MAN'S LEFT LEG WAS JERKED FREE OF THE GROUND AND BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO CATCH HIS BALANCE THE FELLOW FELL HEAVILY ON HIS SIDE TAD WITH KEEN SATISFACTION
6482-289558-0034 HEARD HIM UTTER A GRUNT AS HE STRUCK BUT BEFORE THE BOY COULD RELEASE HIMSELF HE WAS GRABBED AND PULLED UP OVER HIS ADVERSARY BY THE LATTER'S LEFT HAND HIS RIGHT STILL BEING PINIONED UNDER HIS OWN BODY
6482-289558-0035 YET THE MOUNTAINEER'S MOVE HAD NOT BEEN ENTIRELY WITHOUT RESULTS FAVORABLE TO HIS CAPTIVE
6482-289558-0036 TAD GROPING FOR A WRESTLER'S HOLD FELT HIS HAND CLOSE OVER THE HILT OF A KNIFE IN THE MAN'S BELT AND AS THE BOY WAS HAULED UPWARD
6482-289558-0037 THE BLADE CAME AWAY FROM ITS SHEATH CLASPED IN TAD'S FIRM GRIP BUT NOT EVEN WITH THIS DEADLY WEAPON IN HAND DID TAD BUTLER FOR A SECOND FORGET HIMSELF HE FLUNG THE KNIFE AS FAR FROM HIM AS HIS PARTLY PINIONED ARMS WOULD PERMIT
6482-289558-0038 AND WITH KEEN SATISFACTION HEARD IT CLATTER ON THE ROCKS SEVERAL FEET AWAY YOU'LL DO IT WITHOUT THAT COWARDLY WEAPON THEN
6482-289558-0039 HOPING THEREBY TO FREE THE PINIONED ARM NOW I'VE GOT YOU YOU YOUNG CUB
6482-289558-0040 ON HIS ADVERSARY'S STOMACH FROM THE GROWL OF RAGE THAT FOLLOWED TAD HAD THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT HIS TACTICS HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT EFFECT YOU YOU ONLY THINK YOU HAVE RETORTED THE BOY BREATHING HEAVILY UNDER THE TERRIBLE STRAIN
6482-289558-0041 TO DO THIS HOWEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVING TAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE OF WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUICK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE AND SO GULPING QUICK SHORT BREATHS AND STRUGGLING WITH HIS SLIGHTLY BUILT ADVERSARY
6482-289558-0042 TAD'S CAPTOR FINALLY MANAGED TO THROW THE LAD OVER ON HIS BACK SO HEAVILY DID TAD STRIKE THAT FOR THE MOMENT THE BREATH WAS FAIRLY KNOCKED FROM HIS BODY RECOVERING HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT HE RAISED A PIERCING CALL FOR HELP
