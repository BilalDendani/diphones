1274-121771-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR AN EVENING VISIT I NOW SAW MUCH LESS OF ELSIE BUT I WENT WITH TURKEY AS OFTEN AS I COULD TO VISIT HER AT HER FATHER'S COTTAGE THE EVENINGS WE SPENT THERE
1274-121771-0001 ARE AMONGST THE HAPPIEST HOURS IN MY MEMORY ONE EVENING IN PARTICULAR APPEARS TO STAND OUT AS A TYPE OF THE WHOLE I REMEMBER EVERY POINT IN THE VISIT I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST THE LAST WE SET OUT AS THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN ON AN EVENING
1274-121771-0002 IN THE END OF APRIL WHEN THE NIGHTLY FROSTS HAD NOT YET VANISHED THE HAIL WAS DANCING ABOUT US AS WE STARTED THE SUN WAS DISAPPEARING IN A BANK OF TAWNY ORANGE CLOUD THE NIGHT WOULD BE COLD AND DARK AND STORMY
1274-121771-0003 BUT WE CARED NOTHING FOR THAT A CONFLICT WITH THE ELEMENTS ALWAYS ADDED TO THE PLEASURE OF ANY UNDERTAKING THEN IT WAS IN THE MIDST OF ANOTHER SHOWER OF HAIL DRIVEN ON THE BLASTS OF A KEEN WIND THAT WE ARRIVED AT THE LITTLE COTTAGE
1274-121771-0004 IT HAD BEEN BUILT BY DUFF HIMSELF TO RECEIVE HIS BRIDE AND ALTHOUGH SINCE ENLARGED WAS STILL A VERY LITTLE HOUSE
1274-121771-0005 BUT THE WALLS WERE OF TURF HE HAD LINED IT WITH BOARDS HOWEVER AND SO MADE IT WARMER AND MORE COMFORTABLE THAN MOST OF THE LABOURERS DWELLINGS WHEN WE ENTERED A GLOWING FIRE OF PEAT WAS ON THE HEARTH
1274-121771-0006 MISSUS DUFF WAS SPINNING AND ELSIE BY THE LIGHT OF A LITTLE OIL LAMP SUSPENDED AGAINST THE WALL WAS TEACHING HER YOUNGEST BROTHER TO READ WHATEVER SHE DID SHE ALWAYS SEEMED IN MY EYES TO DO IT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE AND TO SEE HER UNDER THE LAMP
1274-121771-0007 WITH ONE ARM ROUND THE LITTLE FELLOW WHO STOOD LEANING AGAINST HER WHILE THE OTHER HAND POINTED WITH A KNITTING NEEDLE TO THE LETTERS OF THE SPELLING BOOK WHICH LAY ON HER KNEE WAS TO SEE A LOVELY PICTURE THE MOTHER DID NOT RISE FROM HER SPINNING BUT SPOKE A KINDLY WELCOME
1274-121771-0008 WHILE ELSIE GOT UP AND WITHOUT APPROACHING US OR SAYING MORE THAN A WORD OR TWO SET CHAIRS FOR US BY THE FIRE AND TOOK THE LITTLE FELLOW AWAY TO PUT HIM TO BED IT'S A COLD NIGHT SAID MISSUS DUFF
1274-121771-0009 THE WIND SEEMS TO BLOW THROUGH ME AS I SIT AT MY WHEEL I WISH MY HUSBAND WOULD COME HOME HE'LL BE SUPPERING HIS HORSES SAID TURKEY I'LL JUST RUN ACROSS AND GIVE HIM A HAND AND THAT'LL BRING HIM IN THE SOONER THANK YOU TURKEY SAID MISSUS DUFF AS HE VANISHED
1274-121771-0010 HE'S A FINE LAD SHE REMARKED MUCH IN THE SAME PHRASE MY FATHER USED WHEN SPEAKING OF HIM THERE'S NOBODY LIKE TURKEY I SAID INDEED I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE RANALD A BETTER BEHAVED LAD DOESN'T STEP
1274-121771-0011 HE'LL DO SOMETHING TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF SOME DAY I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF HE WENT TO COLLEGE AND WAGGED HIS HEAD IN A PULPIT YET THE IDEA OF TURKEY WAGGING HIS HEAD IN A PULPIT MADE ME LAUGH WAIT TILL YOU SEE RESUMED MISSUS DUFF
1274-121771-0012 SOMEWHAT OFFENDED AT MY RECEPTION OF HER PROPHECY FOLK WILL HEAR OF HIM YET I DIDN'T MEAN HE COULDN'T BE A MINISTER MISSUS DUFF
1274-121771-0013 HERE ELSIE CAME BACK AND LIFTING THE LID OF THE POT EXAMINED THE STATE OF ITS CONTENTS I GOT HOLD OF HER HAND BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE WITHDREW IT I DID NOT FEEL HURT FOR SHE DID IT VERY GENTLY
1274-121771-0014 THE WATER IN THE POT WAS BOILING AND SHE BEGAN TO MAKE THE PORRIDGE AT WHICH SHE WAS JUDGED TO BE FIRST RATE IN MY MIND EQUAL TO OUR KIRSTY BY THE TIME IT WAS READY HER FATHER AND TURKEY CAME IN
1274-121771-0015 THE WIND WAS BLOWING HARD OUTSIDE AND EVERY NOW AND THEN THE HAIL CAME IN DEAFENING RATTLES AGAINST THE LITTLE WINDOWS AND DESCENDING THE WIDE CHIMNEY DANCED ON THE FLOOR ABOUT THE HEARTH BUT NOT A THOUGHT OF THE LONG STORMY WAY BETWEEN US AND HOME
1274-121771-0016 AFTER SUPPER WHICH WAS ENLIVENED BY SIMPLE CHAT ABOUT THE CROPS AND THE DOINGS ON THE FARM JAMES TURNED TO ME AND SAID
