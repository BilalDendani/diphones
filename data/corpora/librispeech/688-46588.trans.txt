688-46588-0000 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID ON GETTING SETTLED ON MY RANCH THE SECOND TIME I WAS IN CALIFORNIA WAS TO GET A WAGON AND GO DOWN TO MY EUCALYPTUS GROVE FOR A LOAD OF THE PALE GREEN AROMATIC BOUGHS WITH WHICH TO TRIM MY ATTIC STUDY FOR THEIR FRAGRANCE IS DELIGHTFUL
688-46588-0001 AND THEIR DELICATE BLUE GREEN TONE LENDS ITSELF READILY TO DECORATIVE PURPOSES WHEN THE SUPPLY NEEDED REPLENISHING I RODE DOWN ON MOUNTAIN BILLY AND CARRIED HOME THE SWEET SMELLING BRANCHES ON THE SADDLE THE GROVE SERVED A MORE UTILITARIAN PURPOSE HOWEVER
688-46588-0002 THE EUCALYPTUS IS AN AUSTRALIAN TREE WITH NARROW STRAIGHT HANGING LEAVES AND ITS RAPID GROWTH MAKES IT USEFUL FOR FIREWOOD A TREE WILL GROW FORTY FEET IN FOUR YEARS
688-46588-0003 AND ITS GREENNESS WAS MOST GRATEFUL TO EYES UNUSED TO THE BRIGHT COLORS AND STRONG LIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA OPPOSITE THE LITTLE GROVE IN A SMALL HOUSE PERCHED ON A HILL AN OLD SEA CAPTAIN LIVED ALONE
688-46588-0004 AS I RODE BY ONE DAY HE SAT WITH HIS FEET HANGING OVER THE EDGE OF THE HIGH PIAZZA LOOKING OFF AS IF ON THE PROW OF HIS VESSEL GAZING OUT TO SEA WHEN I STOPPED TO ASK IF HE HAD SEEN ANYTHING NOTEWORTHY HAPPEN AT THE GROVE
688-46588-0005 HE HAD SPOKEN IN AN IMPERSONAL WAY THAT I QUITE UNDERSTOOD HE HAD BEEN TAKEN UNAWARES BUT THE NEXT TIME I RODE PAST AS IF TO MAKE UP FOR ANY APPARENT RUDENESS HE CAME HURRYING DOWN THE WALK TO TELL ME OF A CROW'S NEST HE HAD SEEN IN THE GROVE
688-46588-0006 TO MARK IT HE HAD FASTENED A PIECE OF PAPER TO THE WIRE FENCE BY THE ROAD AND ANOTHER PAPER TO THE NEST TREE BINDING IT ON WITH A EUCALYPTUS TWIG IN TRUE SAILOR FASHION IT WAS ALWAYS A RELIEF TO LEAVE THE HOT BEATING SUN AND THE GLARE OF THE YELLOW FIELDS
688-46588-0007 AND ENTER THE COOL SHADE OF THE QUIET GROVE I COULD LET DOWN THE FENCE AND PUT IT UP BEHIND ME THUS HAVING MY SMALL FOREST ALL TO MYSELF AND USED TO ENJOY RIDING UP AND DOWN THE FRAGRANT BLUE AVENUES THE EUCALYPTUS TREES ALTHOUGH THIRTY OR FORTY FEET HIGH
688-46588-0008 WERE LITHE AND SLENDER SOME OF THEM COULD BE SPANNED BY THE HANDS THE ROWS WERE PLANTED TEN FEET APART BUT THE LONG BRANCHES INTERLACED SO ONE HAD TO BE ON THE ALERT IN RIDING DOWN THE LINES TO BEND LOW ON THE SADDLE OR PUSH ASIDE THE BRANCHES THAT OBSTRUCTED THE WAY
688-46588-0009 THE LIMBS WERE SO SLENDER AND FLEXIBLE THAT A TOUCH WAS ENOUGH TO BEND BACK A GREEN GATE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FEET LONG AND BILLY OFTEN PUSHED A BRANCH ASIDE WITH HIS NOSE IN PLACES FALLEN TREES BARRED OUR PATH BUT BILLY USED TO STEP CAREFULLY OVER THEM
688-46588-0010 THE EUCALYPTUS TREES CHANGE VERY CURIOUSLY AS THEY GROW OLD WHEN YOUNG THEY ARE COVERED WITH BRANCHES LOW TO THE GROUND AND THEIR AROMATIC TENDER LEAVES ARE LIGHT BLUISH GREEN AFTERWARDS THEY LOSE THEIR LOWER BRANCHES WHILE THEIR LEAVES BECOME STIFF AND SICKLE SHAPED
688-46588-0011 DULL GREEN AND ALMOST ODORLESS THE SAME CHANGES ARE SEEN IN THE BARK FIRST THE TRUNKS ARE SMOOTH AND GREEN THEN THEY ARE HUNG WITH SHAGGY SHREDS OF BARK THIS IN TURN DROPS OFF SO THAT THE OLD TREES ARE SMOOTH AGAIN
688-46588-0012 BUT MY FIRST INTEREST WAS IN FINDING OUT WHO LIVED IN MY LITTLE WOODS A DOG HAD ONCE BEEN SEEN DRIVING A COYOTE WOLF OUT OF IT BUT THAT WAS MERELY IN PASSING I DID NOT EXPECT TO MEET WOLVES THERE IT WAS SAID HOWEVER TO BE A GOOD PLACE FOR TARANTULAS
688-46588-0013 FOR THE EUCALYPTUS ABSORBED ALL THE MOISTURE AND THAT MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH ITS FREEDOM FROM SNAKES AND SCORPIONS THOUGH IT WOULD NOT EXPLAIN THE ABSENCE OF CATERPILLARS AND SPIDERS WHICH JUST THEN WERE SO COMMON OUTSIDE THOUGH IN THE GROVE A GREAT DEAL
688-46588-0014 I NEVER RAN INTO BUT ONE COBWEB AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE PLEASANT FREEDOM FROM FALLING CATERPILLARS MOREOVER I NEVER SAW A LIZARD IN THE BLUE GUMS THOUGH DOZENS OF THEM WERE TO BE SEEN ABOUT THE OAKS AND IN THE BRUSH IT WAS A SURPRISE TO FIND SO MANY FEATHERED FOLKS LIVING IN THE EUCALYPTUS
688-46588-0015 AND I TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN EACH ONE OF THE INHABITANTS THE FIRST TIME WE STARTED TO GO UP AND DOWN THE AVENUES WE SCARED UP A PAIR OF TURTLE DOVES BEAUTIFUL DELICATELY TINTED GENTLE CREATURES FIT TENANTS OF THE LOVELY GROVE
688-46588-0016 IN SUCH A MARKED MANNER THAT WHEN WE PASSED A YOUNG DOVE A FEW YARDS FARTHER ON IT WAS EASY TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
688-46588-0017 AND THE GROVE BECAME MUSICAL WITH THE SWEET CALLS OF THE YOUNG BROOD
688-46588-0018 OR WHETHER THE BARK HAD FALLEN DOWN ON THEM AFTER THEY BUILT I COULD GET NO TRACE OF THE OWNERS OF THE NEST AND IT TROUBLED ME NOT LIKING TO HAVE ANY LITTLE HOMES IN MY WOOD THAT I DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT
688-46588-0019 IN ONE OF THE TREES WE CAME TO AN ENORMOUS NEST MADE OF THE UNUSUAL MATERIALS THAT ARE SOMETIMES CHOSEN BY THAT STRANGE BIRD THE ROAD RUNNER IT WAS AN EXCITING DISCOVERY FOR THAT WAS BEFORE THE ROAD RUNNER HAD COME TO THE RANCH HOUSE
688-46588-0020 AND I HAD BEEN PURSUING PHANTOM RUNNERS OVER THE HILLS IN THE VAIN ATTEMPT TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THEM WHILE HERE IT SEEMED ONE HAD BEEN LIVING UNDER MY VERY VINE AND FIG TREE TO MAKE SURE ABOUT THE NEST I SPOKE TO MY NEIGHBOR RANCHMAN
688-46588-0021 AND HE TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE HAD BEEN MILKING DURING THE SPRING HE HAD OFTEN SEEN THE BIRDS COME OUT OF THE BLUE GUMS AND HAD ALSO SEEN THEM PERCHING THERE ON THE TREES HOW EXASPERATING IF I HAD ONLY COME EARLIER NOW THEY HAD GONE AND MY CHANCE OF A NEST STUDY WAS LOST
688-46588-0022 BUT MY DOLL WAS NOT STUFFED WITH SAWDUST FOR ALL OF THAT THERE WAS STILL MUCH TO ENJOY FOR A MOURNING DOVE FLEW FROM HER NEST OF TWIGS ALMOST OVER BILLY'S HEAD AND IT MADE ME QUITE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT THE GENTLE BIRD WAS BROODING HER EGGS IN MY WOODS
688-46588-0023 IT SEEMED ODD FOR THERE WAS HER LITTLE COUSIN NESTING OUT IN THE WEEDS IN THE BRIGHT SUN WHILE SHE WAS RAISING HER BROOD IN THE SHADY FOREST THE TWO NESTS WERE AS UNLIKE AS THE SITES THE BIRD OUTSIDE HAD USED DULL GREEN WEEDS WHILE THIS ONE USED BEAUTIFUL SHINING OAK STEMS
688-46588-0024 I THOUGHT THE PRETTY BIRD WOULD SURELY BE SAFE HERE BUT ONE DAY WHEN I CALLED EXPECTING TO SEE A GROWING FAMILY I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND A PATHETIC LITTLE SKELETON IN THE NEST ONE AFTERNOON IN RIDING DOWN THE ROWS I CAME FACE TO FACE
688-46588-0025 WITH TWO MITES OF HUMMINGBIRDS SEATED ON A BRANCH THEIR GRAYISH GREEN SUITS TONED IN WITH THE COLOR OF THE BLUE GUMS IT WAS A SURPRISE WHEN ONE OF THEM TURNED TO THE OTHER AND FED IT THE MOTHER HUMMER WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO BE TAKEN FOR A NESTLING
688-46588-0026 HE SAT VERY UNCONCERNEDLY ON A LOW BRANCH RIGHT OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD BUT BILLY DID NOT RUN OVER HIM I FOUND TWO HUMMERS NESTS IN THE EUCALYPTUS DURING THE SUMMER ONE BUILDER WAS THE ONE THE PHOTOGRAPHER WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO CATCH BROODING
688-46588-0027 MAKING IT THE HIGHEST HUMMINGBIRD'S NEST I HAD EVER SEEN IT WAS ATTACHED TO A RED LEAF TO MARK THE SPOT PERHAPS ONE OFTEN WONDERS HOW A BIRD CAN COME BACK TWICE TO THE SAME LEAF IN A FOREST HOW ONE LITTLE HOME DOES MAKE A PLACE HABITABLE
688-46588-0028 FROM A BARE SILENT WOODS IT BECOMES A DWELLING PLACE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO CENTRE AROUND THIS LITTLE NEST THEN THE ONLY ONE IN THE GROVE THE TINY PINCH OF DOWN BECAME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WOODS IT WAS THE CASTLE WHICH THE TREES SURROUNDED WHEN I FIRST FOUND THE NEST
688-46588-0029 AND I BECAME MUCH INTERESTED IN WATCHING THEIR PROGRESS OFTEN RIDING DOWN TO SEE HOW THEY WERE GETTING ON THE HUMMER DID NOT RETURN MY INTEREST SHE WAS NERVOUS DARTING OFF WHEN BILLY SHOOK HIMSELF OR WHEN THE SHADOW OF A SOARING TURKEY BUZZARD FELL OVER THE NEST
688-46588-0030 BUT IN SPITE OF THAT WE MADE OURSELVES QUITE AT HOME BEFORE HER DOOR I WOULD DISMOUNT AND SIT ON THE GROUND LEANING AGAINST A BLUE GUM WHILE BILLY STOOD BY IN A BOWER OF GREEN LEAVES WITH EARS PRICKED FORWARD THOUGHTFULLY AND A DREAMY LOOK OF SATISFACTION IN HIS EYES
688-46588-0031 SOON SHE BEGAN TO ACT SO STRANGELY FOR A BROODING BIRD THAT WHEN SHE FLEW I WENT TO FEEL IN THE NEST THE TIPS OF MY FINGERS TOUCHED WHAT FELT LIKE ROUND BALLS BUT NOT SATISFIED I PULLED DOWN THE BOUGH AND FOUND ONE ROUND BALL
688-46588-0032 AND ONE MITE OF A GRAY BACK WITH MICROSCOPIC YELLOW HAIRS ON EACH SIDE OF THE SPINE THE WHOLE TINY BODY SEEMED TO THROB WITH ITS HEART BEATS I WONDERED HOW SUCH A MIDGET COULD EVER BE FED BUT FOUND AS IN THE CASE OF THE HUMMER UNDER THE LITTLE LOVER'S TREE
688-46588-0033 THAT THE MOTHER GAVE ITS FOOD MOST GENTLY RESERVING HER VIOLENT PUMPING FOR A MORE SUITABLE AGE THOUGH ONE WOULD AS SOON THINK OF POKING A NEEDLE DOWN A BABY'S THROAT AS THAT BILL OFTEN WHILE WATCHING THE NEST MY THOUGHTS WANDERED AWAY TO THE GROVE ITSELF
688-46588-0034 THE BROWN EARTH BETWEEN THE ROWS WAS BARRED BY ALTERNATE LINES OF SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW AND THE VISTA OF EACH AVENUE ENDED IN BLUE SKY SOMETIMES COOL OCEAN BREEZES WOULD PENETRATE THE FOREST THE ROWS OF TREES WITH THEIR GENTLY SWAYING INTERLACING BRANCHES
688-46588-0035 CAST MOVING SHADOWS OVER THE SUN TOUCHED LEAFY FLOOR GIVING A WHITE LIGHT TO THE GROVE FOR THE UNDERSIDES OF THE YOUNG EUCALYPTUS LEAVES ARE LIKE SNOW FROM THE STIFF SICKLE SHAPED UPPER LEAVES THE SUN GLANCED DAZZLING THE EYES
688-46588-0036 MOURNING DOVES COOED AND THE SWEET NOTES OF YELLOW BIRDS FILLED THE SUNNY GROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS OF HAPPINESS A YELLOW BUTTERFLY WANDERED DOWN THE BLUE AISLES SUCH A SECURE RETREAT I RETURNED TO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN COMING IN OUT OF THE HOT YELLOW WORLD
688-46588-0037 AND CLOSING BEHIND ME THE DOORS OF MY REST HOUSE FOR THE LITTLE WOOD HAD COME TO SEEM LIKE A COOL WAYSIDE CHAPEL A PLACE OF PEACE
