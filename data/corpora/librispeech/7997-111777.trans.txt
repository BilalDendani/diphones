7997-111777-0000 EDWIN M STANTON EDWIN M STANTON WHOM PRESIDENT LINCOLN SELECTED FOR HIS SECRETARY OF WAR NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT HE HAD SERVED IN THE CABINET OF BUCHANAN WAS BORN AT STEUBENVILLE OHIO DECEMBER NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN
7997-111777-0001 AND DIED IN WASHINGTON D C DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE WHEN FIFTEEN YEARS OLD HE BECAME A CLERK IN A BOOK STORE IN HIS NATIVE TOWN AND WITH MONEY THUS ACCUMULATED WAS ENABLED TO ATTEND KENYON COLLEGE
7997-111777-0002 BUT AT THE END OF TWO YEARS WAS OBLIGED TO RE ENTER THE BOOK STORE AS A CLERK THUS THROUGH POVERTY HE WAS DETERRED FROM GRADUATING BUT KNOWLEDGE IS JUST AS BENEFICIAL WHETHER ACQUIRED IN SCHOOL OR OUT
7997-111777-0003 THURLOW WEED NEVER HAD THE ADVANTAGES OF A COLLEGE BUT STRETCHED PRONE BEFORE THE SAP HOUSE FIRE HE LAID THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH HE BUILT THAT SPLENDID REPUTATION AS AN ABLE EDITOR ELIHU BURITT NEVER SAW THE INSIDE OF A COLLEGE SCHOOL ROOM
7997-111777-0004 AS A STUDENT BUT WHILE AT THE ANVIL AT WORK AS A BLACKSMITH WITH BOOK LAYING ON A DESK NEAR HE FRAMED THE BASIS OF THAT CLASSICAL LEARNING WHICH MADE HIM AS MASTER OF FORTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES
7997-111777-0005 THE ESTEEMED FRIEND OF JOHN BRIGHT AND OTHERS OF THE MOST NOTED PEOPLE THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN AS IT WAS WITH THEM SO IT WAS WITH STANTON HE HAD BUT LITTLE ADVANTAGES BUT HE WOULD NOT DOWN IT IS SAID THAT IF HENRY WARD BEECHER HAD GONE TO SEA
7997-111777-0006 AS HE DESIRED TO DO HE WOULD NOT HAVE LONG REMAINED FOR IN HIM WAS EVEN THEN A SLUMBERING GENIUS BUT HE HIMSELF ONCE SAID THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIS GREAT LOVE OF WORK HE NEVER COULD HAVE HALF SUCCEEDED
7997-111777-0007 AH THAT'S IT IF ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH HARD DIGGING IS NOT GENIUS IT IS THE BEST POSSIBLE SUBSTITUTE FOR IT A MAN MAY HAVE IN HIM A SLUMBERING GENIUS
7997-111777-0008 THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU ARE TO BE A MILTON A CROMWELL A WEBSTER OR A CLAY THAT YOU CANNOT HELP IT DO WHAT YOU WILL POSSIBLY THIS MAY BE SO IT MAY NOT BE THOUGHT PROPER FOR ME TO DISPUTE THEIR LORDSHIP
7997-111777-0009 BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT SUCH ARGUMENTS CAN GIVE BUT LITTLE HOPE IF THEY HAVE INFLUENCE AT ALL IT CANNOT BE AN INSPIRING ONE NO NEVER MIND THE REPUTATION NEVER PINE TO BE A LINCOLN OR A GARFIELD
7997-111777-0010 BUT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR CHANCES IN YOUTH ARE EQUAL TO THEIRS TAKE COURAGE WORK
7997-111777-0011 IF A BOOT BLACK MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO MONOPOLIZE THE BUSINESS ON YOUR BLOCK FACULTY TO DO THIS IS THE BEST POSSIBLE SUBSTITUTE FOR A SLUMBERING GENIUS IF PERCHANCE YOU SHOULD LACK THAT MOST ESSENTIAL
7997-111777-0012 FACULTY TO SUCCESS AT ANY RATE NEVER WAIT FOR THE SLUMBERING GENIUS TO SHOW ITSELF IF YOU DO IT WILL NEVER AWAKE BUT SLUMBER ON THROUGH ENDLESS TIME AND LEAVE YOU
7997-111777-0013 GROPING ON IN MIDNIGHT DARKNESS BUT TO RETURN TO STANTON WHETHER HE POSSESSED A SLUMBERING GENIUS DOES NOT APPEAR BUT CERTAIN IT IS THAT BY DOWN RIGHT HARD WORK HE GAINED A KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW
7997-111777-0014 AND WAS ADMITTED TO THE BAR IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX WHEN IN HIS TWENTY FIRST YEAR WHILE YET A YOUNG LAWYER HE WAS MADE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY OF HARRISON COUNTY
7997-111777-0015 IN EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO HE WAS CHOSEN REPORTER OF THE OHIO SUPREME COURT AND PUBLISHED THREE VOLUMES OF REPORTS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN HE MOVED TO PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA BUT FOR NINE YEARS AFTERWARD RETAINED HIS OFFICE IN STEUBENVILLE
7997-111777-0016 AS WELL AS THAT IN PITTSBURGH IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN HIS BUSINESS HAD SO EXPANDED THAT HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MOVE TO WASHINGTON D C THE SEAT OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
7997-111777-0017 HIS FIRST APPEARANCE BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WAS IN DEFENCE OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA AGAINST THE WHEELING AND BELMONT BRIDGE COMPANY AND THEREAFTER HIS PRACTICE RAPIDLY INCREASED
7997-111777-0018 THIS GREAT LEGAL SUCCESS TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHERS WON FOR HIM A NATIONAL REPUTATION IT HAS BEEN STATED BY ONE OF THE LEADING JURISTS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THE CAUSE OF NINE OUT OF TEN OF THE FAILURES IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION
7997-111777-0019 IS LAZINESS SO COMMON IN LAWYERS AFTER BEING ADMITTED TO THE BAR ONCE IN THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT THEY HAVE BUT TO SIT AND WAIT FOR BUSINESS POSSIBLY THEIR EYE HAS AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER
7997-111777-0020 CAUGHT THOSE SENTIMENTS SO DEAR TO SOME WRITERS IN REGARD TO THE SLUMBERING GENIUS BE THAT AS IT MAY IT IS VERY EVIDENT THAT STANTON HAD NEVER BEEN IDLE
7997-111777-0021 AND WAS SELDOM OBLIGED TO REFER TO HIS LIBRARY BEFORE ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN RELATION TO THE LAW HE WAS CALLED TO THE HIGH POSITION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL IN PRESIDENT BUCHANAN'S CABINET AND ON JANUARY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
7997-111777-0022 NINE MONTHS AFTER THE INAUGURATION OF LINCOLN HE WAS PLACED IN THE MOST RESPONSIBLE POSITION IN HIS CABINET AT THAT TIME SECRETARY OF WAR HIS LABORS IN THIS DEPARTMENT WERE INDEFATIGABLE AND MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
7997-111777-0023 AND SUCCESSFUL MOVEMENTS OF THE WAR ORIGINATED WITH HIM NEVER PERHAPS WAS THERE A MORE ILLUSTRIOUS EXAMPLE OF THE RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT SEEMED ALMOST AS IF
7997-111777-0024 IT WERE A SPECIAL PROVINCIAL INTERPOSITION TO INCLINE THE PRESIDENT TO GO OUT OF HIS OWN PARTY AND SELECT THIS MAN FOR THIS MOST RESPONSIBLE OF ALL TRUSTS SAVE HIS OWN WITH AN UNFLINCHING FORCE
7997-111777-0025 AND EXACTED BRAVE MIGHTY ENDEAVOR OF ALL YET ONLY LIKE WHAT HE EXACTED OF HIMSELF HE REORGANIZED THE WAR WITH HERCULEAN TOIL THROUGH ALL THOSE LONG YEARS OF WAR HE THOUGHT OF SAW
7997-111777-0026 LABORED FOR ONE END VICTORY THE AMOUNT OF WORK HE DOES IN SOME OF THESE CRITICAL MONTHS WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING BY ITS COMPREHENSION OF DETAILS THE SOLUTION OF VEXED QUESTIONS
7997-111777-0027 THE MASTERY OF FORMIDABLE DIFFICULTIES WONDER WAS IT HIS WORD SOMETIMES CUT LIKE A SHARP QUICK BLOW OR THAT THE STROKE OF HIS PEN WAS SOMETIMES LIKE A THUNDERBOLT
7997-111777-0028 IT WAS NOT THE TIME FOR HESITATION OR DOUBT OR EVEN ARGUMENT HE MEANT HIS IMPERILED COUNTRY SHOULD BE SAVED AND WHATEVER BY HALF LOYALTY OR SELF SEEKING SEEMED TO STAND IN THE WAY ONLY ATTRACTED
7997-111777-0029 THE LIGHTNING OF HIS POWER THE NATION OWES AS MUCH TO HIM AS TO ANY ONE WHO IN COUNCIL OR IN FIELD CONTRIBUTED TO ITS SALVATION AND HIS REAL GREATNESS WAS NEVER MORE CONSPICUOUS
7997-111777-0030 THAN AT THE TIME OF MISTER LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION HIS PRESENCE OF MIND HIS PROMPT DECISION HIS UNFAILING FAITH AND COURAGE STRENGTHENED THOSE ABOUT HIM
7997-111777-0031 AND DISORDER FOLLOWING THAT UNEXPECTED ASSAULT UPON THE LIFE OF THE REPUBLIC TO HAVE EQUIPPED FED CLOTHED AND ORGANIZED A MILLION AND A HALF OF SOLDIERY
7997-111777-0032 AND WHEN THEIR WORK WAS DONE IN TWO DAYS TO HAVE REMANDED THEM BACK TO THE PEACEFUL INDUSTRIES FROM WHICH THEY HAD BEEN CALLED TO HAVE HAD THE NATION'S WEALTH AT HIS DISPOSAL AND YET SO INCORRUPTIBLE
7997-111777-0033 SUCH A MAN SO TRUE SO INTENT UPON GREAT OBJECTS MUST MANY A TIME HAVE THWARTED THE GREED OF THE CORRUPT BEEN IMPATIENT WITH THE HESITATION OF THE IMBECILE AND FIERCELY INDIGNANT AGAINST HALF HEARTEDNESS
7997-111777-0034 AND DISLOYALTY WHATEVER FAULTS THEREFORE HIS ENEMIES MAY ALLEGE THESE WILL ALL FADE AWAY IN THE SPLENDOR WITH WHICH COMING AGES WILL ENNOBLE THE GREATEST OF WAR MINISTERS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY

7997-111777-0036 NOR WERE HIS SERVICES LESS VALUABLE TO HIS COUNTRY WHEN AFTER THE SURRENDER OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMIES THE REBELLION WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND HE STOOD THE FEARLESS UNFLINCHING PATRIOT
7997-111777-0037 AGAINST THE SCHEMES AND USURPATIONS OF ITS ACCIDENTAL OCCUPANT MISTER STANTON ENTERED ON HIS GREAT TRUST IN THE FULLEST PRIME OF MANHOOD EQUAL SEEMINGLY TO ANY POSSIBLE TOIL AND STRAIN

7997-111777-0039 AND INSUFFICIENT YET WHEN IT WAS CONTEMPLATED BY SOME OF HIS FRIENDS AFTER HIS RETIREMENT TO TENDER HIM A HANDSOME GIFT OF MONEY HE RESOLUTELY AND UNHESITATINGLY FORBADE IT AND THE PROJECT HAD TO BE ABANDONED
7997-111777-0040 HE WAS AS TRULY A SACRIFICE TO HIS COUNTRY AS WAS THE BRAVE SOLDIER WHO LAID DOWN HIS LIFE IN THE PRISON PEN OR SANCTIFIED THE FIELD WITH HIS BLOOD FOR AN UNSWERVING AND PASSIONATE PATRIOTISM
7997-111777-0041 FOR A MAGNIFICENT COURAGE FOR RARE UNSELFISHNESS FOR TRANSCENDENT ABILITIES FOR IMMEASURABLE SERVICES TO HIS COUNTRY THE FIGURE OF THE GREATEST WAR MINISTER IN MODERN TIMES
7997-111777-0042 WILL TOWER WITH A NOBLE GRANDEUR AS UNDIMMED AND ENVIABLE A SPLENDOR AS THAT OF ANY IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC WHICH LIKE HIS FRIEND AND CO WORKER THE GREAT LINCOLN
