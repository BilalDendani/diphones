6519-69411-0000 THE INTENSITY OF THE QUESTION THE COMPELLING SELF FORGETFUL PASSION OF THE MAN
6519-69411-0001 WITH ONE ACCORD AND WITHOUT STOPPING TO PICK THEIR WAY THEY MADE FOR THE OPEN DOORWAY KNOCKING THE SMALLER PIECES OF FURNITURE ABOUT AND CREATING HAVOC GENERALLY SOME FLED THE HOUSE
6519-69411-0002 OF COMBINED MOVEMENT AND SOUND SHE STEPPED WITHIN THE LINE OF HIS VISION AND LIFTED HER FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL HAND IN AN EFFORT TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION TO HERSELF BUT HE DID NOT NOTICE HER ANY MORE THAN HE HAD NOTICED THE OTHERS
6519-69411-0003 SHE STOOD THERE THE WOMAN STOOD THERE AND I SAW HER WHERE IS SHE NOW SHE IS NO LONGER IN THE HOUSE CAME IN GENTLE REPLY FROM THE ONLY ONE IN OR OUT OF THE ROOM COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO SPEAK
6519-69411-0004 SHE WENT OUT WHEN SHE SAW US COMING WE KNEW THAT SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO BE HERE THAT IS WHY WE INTRUDED OURSELVES SIR WE DID NOT LIKE THE LOOKS OF HER AND SO FOLLOWED HER IN TO PREVENT MISCHIEF AH
6519-69411-0005 NOR EXPLAIN TO HIMSELF SHE WAS HERE THEN A WOMAN WITH A LITTLE CHILD
6519-69411-0006 AND THUNDERED OUT IN GREAT INDIGNATION HOW DARED YOU
6519-69411-0007 AND HOW EVEN IF YOU HAD THE TEMERITY
6519-69411-0008 DID YOU MANAGE TO PASS MY GATES THEY ARE NEVER OPEN BELA SEES TO THAT BELA
6519-69411-0009 WHICH BLANCHED HER SMALL TENSE FEATURES AS THIS NAME FELL SO NATURALLY FROM HIS LIPS
6519-69411-0010 FOR AS SHE WATCHED SHE SAW HIS EYES FIXED UP TO NOW UPON HER FACE LEAVE IT AND PASS FURTIVELY
6519-69411-0011 TOWARDS THAT SPOT BEHIND HIM WHERE LAY THE SOURCE OF HER GREAT TERROR
6519-69411-0012 SHE KNEW JUST WHERE HIS GLANCES FELL WITHOUT FOLLOWING THEM WITH HER OWN SHE SAW THEM PASS THE DOOR WHERE SO MANY FACES YET PEERED IN HE SAW THEM NOT
6519-69411-0013 INCH BY INCH BREATHLESSLY AND WITH DREAD TILL FINALLY WITH FATAL PRECISION THEY REACHED THE POINT WHERE THE SCREEN HAD STOOD AND NOT FINDING IT
6519-69411-0014 WHEN THAT SOMETHING ELSE HUDDLED IN OOZING BLOOD ON THE FLOOR BENEATH DREW THEM UNTO ITSELF WITH THE IRRESISTIBLENESS OF GRIM REALITY AND HE FORGOT ALL ELSE IN THE HORROR OF A SIGHT FOR WHICH HIS FEARS HOWEVER GREAT
6519-69411-0015 HAD FAILED TO PREPARE HIM DEAD
6519-69411-0016 THE REST MAY HAVE BEEN NO DREAM BUT THIS WAS SURELY ONE OR HIS EYES
6519-69411-0017 GRASPING THE TABLE AT HIS SIDE TO STEADY HIS FAILING LIMBS
6519-69411-0018 WHICH FOR SO MANY YEARS HAD BEEN THE EMBODIMENT
6519-69411-0019 DID THE TRUTH OF HIS GREAT MISFORTUNE BURST UPON HIS BEWILDERED SOUL AND WITH A CRY WHICH TORE THE EARS OF ALL HEARERS AND WAS NEVER FORGOTTEN BY ANY ONE THERE HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN BESIDE THE DEAD NEGRO
6519-69411-0020 WAS THAT A SOB YES THUS MUCH THE HEART GAVE
6519-69411-0021 AND BOUNDING TO HIS FEET WITH THE CRY KILLED KILLED AT HIS POST HE CONFRONTED THE ONE WITNESS OF HIS ANGUISH OF WHOSE PRESENCE HE WAS AWARE AND FIERCELY DEMANDED
6519-69411-0022 NO SINGLE ARM COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN BELA HE HAS BEEN SET UPON
6519-69411-0023 AND HERE HIS THOUGHT WAS CAUGHT UP BY ANOTHER AND THAT ONE SO FEARSOME AND UNSETTLING THAT BEWILDERMENT AGAIN FOLLOWED RAGE AND WITH THE LOOK OF A HAUNTED SPIRIT HE DEMANDED IN A VOICE MADE LOW BY AWE AND DREAD OF ITS OWN SOUND AND WHERE WAS I
6519-69411-0024 WHEN ALL THIS HAPPENED YOU YOU WERE SEATED THERE MURMURED THE LITTLE WOMAN POINTING AT THE GREAT CHAIR YOU WERE NOT QUITE QUITE YOURSELF SHE SOFTLY EXPLAINED WONDERING AT HER OWN COMPOSURE
6519-69411-0025 THEN QUICKLY AS SHE SAW HIS THOUGHTS REVERT TO THE DEAD FRIEND AT HIS FEET BELA WAS NOT HURT HERE HE WAS DOWN TOWN WHEN IT HAPPENED BUT HE MANAGED TO STRUGGLE HOME AND GAIN THIS PLACE WHICH HE TRIED TO HOLD AGAINST THE MEN WHO FOLLOWED HIM
6519-69411-0026 HE THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD YOU SAT THERE SO RIGID AND SO WHITE AND BEFORE HE QUITE GAVE UP HE ASKED US ALL TO PROMISE NOT TO LET ANY ONE ENTER THIS ROOM TILL YOUR SON OLIVER CAME UNDERSTANDING PARTLY
6519-69411-0027 THE JUDGE SIGHED AND STOOPING AGAIN STRAIGHTENED THE FAITHFUL NEGRO'S LIMBS THEN WITH A SIDE LONG LOOK IN HER DIRECTION HE FELT IN ONE OF THE POCKETS OF THE DEAD NEGRO'S COAT AND DRAWING OUT A SMALL KEY HELD IT IN ONE HAND
6519-69411-0028 WHILE HE FUMBLED IN HIS OWN FOR ANOTHER WHICH FOUND HE BECAME ON THE INSTANT HIS OWN MAN AGAIN MISS WEEKS SEEING THE DIFFERENCE IN HIM AND SEEING TOO THAT THE DOORWAY WAS NOW CLEAR OF THE WONDERING AWESTRUCK GROUP WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BLOCKED IT
6519-69411-0029 BOWED HER SLIGHT BODY AND PROCEEDED TO WITHDRAW
6519-69411-0030 SHE WAITED PATIENTLY NEAR ONE OF THE BOOK RACKS AGAINST WHICH SHE HAD STUMBLED TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY I MUST HAVE HAD AN ATTACK OF SOME KIND HE CALMLY REMARKED WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT OCCURRED HERE THAT I MAY
6519-69411-0031 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED DOWN TOWN SHE COULD ONLY TELL WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE HER EYES BUT THERE WAS ONE THING SHE COULD MAKE CLEAR TO HIM AND THAT WAS HOW THE SEEMINGLY IMPASSABLE GATES HAD BEEN MADE READY FOR THE WOMAN'S ENTRANCE
6519-69411-0032 AND AFTERWARDS TAKEN SUCH ADVANTAGE OF BY HERSELF AND OTHERS A PEBBLE HAD DONE IT ALL A PEBBLE PLACED IN THE GATEWAY BY BELA'S HANDS AS SHE DESCRIBED THIS AND INSISTED UPON THE FACT IN FACE OF THE JUDGE'S ALMOST FRENZIED DISCLAIMER
6519-69411-0033 FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AT THE MOMENT CONSCIOUSNESS HAD LEFT HIM EVIDENTLY THIS INTRUSIVE LITTLE BODY DID NOT KNOW BELA OR HIS STORY OR WHY SHOULD INTERRUPTION COME THEN
