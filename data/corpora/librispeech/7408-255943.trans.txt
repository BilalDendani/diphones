7408-255943-0000 THE CEMETERY OF THE CHATEAU D'IF ON THE BED AT FULL LENGTH AND FAINTLY ILLUMINATED BY THE PALE LIGHT THAT CAME FROM THE WINDOW LAY A SACK OF CANVAS AND UNDER ITS RUDE FOLDS WAS STRETCHED A LONG AND STIFFENED FORM
7408-255943-0001 IT WAS FARIA'S LAST WINDING SHEET A WINDING SHEET WHICH AS THE TURNKEY SAID COST SO LITTLE EVERYTHING WAS IN READINESS
7408-255943-0002 NO LONGER COULD EDMOND LOOK INTO THOSE WIDE OPEN EYES WHICH HAD SEEMED TO BE PENETRATING THE MYSTERIES OF DEATH NO LONGER COULD HE CLASP THE HAND WHICH HAD DONE SO MUCH TO MAKE HIS EXISTENCE BLESSED FARIA THE BENEFICENT AND CHEERFUL COMPANION
7408-255943-0003 WITH WHOM HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE SO INTIMATELY NO LONGER BREATHED HE SEATED HIMSELF ON THE EDGE OF THAT TERRIBLE BED AND FELL INTO MELANCHOLY AND GLOOMY REVERY ALONE HE WAS ALONE AGAIN AGAIN CONDEMNED TO SILENCE
7408-255943-0004 AGAIN FACE TO FACE WITH NOTHINGNESS ALONE NEVER AGAIN TO SEE THE FACE NEVER AGAIN TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE ONLY HUMAN BEING WHO UNITED HIM TO EARTH
7408-255943-0005 TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF LIFE AT ITS SOURCE EVEN AT THE RISK OF HORRIBLE SUFFERING THE IDEA OF SUICIDE WHICH HIS FRIEND HAD DRIVEN AWAY AND KEPT AWAY BY HIS CHEERFUL PRESENCE NOW HOVERED LIKE A PHANTOM OVER THE ABBE'S DEAD BODY
7408-255943-0006 IF I COULD DIE HE SAID I SHOULD GO WHERE HE GOES AND SHOULD ASSUREDLY FIND HIM AGAIN BUT HOW TO DIE IT IS VERY EASY HE WENT ON WITH A SMILE I WILL REMAIN HERE
7408-255943-0007 RUSH ON THE FIRST PERSON THAT OPENS THE DOOR STRANGLE HIM AND THEN THEY WILL GUILLOTINE ME BUT EXCESSIVE GRIEF IS LIKE A STORM AT SEA WHERE THE FRAIL BARK IS TOSSED FROM THE DEPTHS TO THE TOP OF THE WAVE DANTES RECOILED FROM THE IDEA OF SO INFAMOUS A DEATH
7408-255943-0008 AND PASSED SUDDENLY FROM DESPAIR TO AN ARDENT DESIRE FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY DIE OH NO HE EXCLAIMED NOT DIE NOW AFTER HAVING LIVED AND SUFFERED SO LONG AND SO MUCH DIE
7408-255943-0009 YES HAD I DIED YEARS AGO BUT NOW TO DIE WOULD BE INDEED TO GIVE WAY TO THE SARCASM OF DESTINY NO I WANT TO LIVE I SHALL STRUGGLE TO THE VERY LAST
7408-255943-0010 AS HE SAID THIS HE BECAME SILENT AND GAZED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM LIKE ONE OVERWHELMED WITH A STRANGE AND AMAZING THOUGHT SUDDENLY HE AROSE LIFTED HIS HAND TO HIS BROW AS IF HIS BRAIN WERE GIDDY
7408-255943-0011 PACED TWICE OR THRICE ROUND THE DUNGEON AND THEN PAUSED ABRUPTLY BY THE BED JUST GOD HE MUTTERED WHENCE COMES THIS THOUGHT IS IT FROM THEE SINCE NONE BUT THE DEAD PASS FREELY FROM THIS DUNGEON
7408-255943-0012 LET ME TAKE THE PLACE OF THE DEAD WITHOUT GIVING HIMSELF TIME TO RECONSIDER HIS DECISION AND INDEED THAT HE MIGHT NOT ALLOW HIS THOUGHTS TO BE DISTRACTED FROM HIS DESPERATE RESOLUTION HE BENT OVER THE APPALLING SHROUD
7408-255943-0013 OPENED IT WITH THE KNIFE WHICH FARIA HAD MADE DREW THE CORPSE FROM THE SACK AND BORE IT ALONG THE TUNNEL TO HIS OWN CHAMBER LAID IT ON HIS COUCH TIED AROUND ITS HEAD THE RAG HE WORE AT NIGHT AROUND HIS OWN COVERED IT WITH HIS COUNTERPANE
7408-255943-0014 ONCE AGAIN KISSED THE ICE COLD BROW AND TRIED VAINLY TO CLOSE THE RESISTING EYES WHICH GLARED HORRIBLY TURNED THE HEAD TOWARDS THE WALL SO THAT THE JAILER MIGHT WHEN HE BROUGHT THE EVENING MEAL BELIEVE THAT HE WAS ASLEEP AS WAS HIS FREQUENT CUSTOM
7408-255943-0015 ENTERED THE TUNNEL AGAIN DREW THE BED AGAINST THE WALL RETURNED TO THE OTHER CELL TOOK FROM THE HIDING PLACE THE NEEDLE AND THREAD FLUNG OFF HIS RAGS THAT THEY MIGHT FEEL ONLY NAKED FLESH BENEATH THE COARSE CANVAS
7408-255943-0016 AND GETTING INSIDE THE SACK PLACED HIMSELF IN THE POSTURE IN WHICH THE DEAD BODY HAD BEEN LAID AND SEWED UP THE MOUTH OF THE SACK FROM THE INSIDE
7408-255943-0017 DANTES MIGHT HAVE WAITED UNTIL THE EVENING VISIT WAS OVER BUT HE WAS AFRAID THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD CHANGE HIS MIND AND ORDER THE DEAD BODY TO BE REMOVED EARLIER IN THAT CASE HIS LAST HOPE WOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED NOW
7408-255943-0018 HIS PLANS WERE FULLY MADE AND THIS IS WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO IF WHILE HE WAS BEING CARRIED OUT THE GRAVE DIGGERS SHOULD DISCOVER THAT THEY WERE BEARING A LIVE INSTEAD OF A DEAD BODY DANTES DID NOT INTEND TO GIVE THEM TIME TO RECOGNIZE HIM BUT WITH A SUDDEN CUT OF THE KNIFE
7408-255943-0019 HE MEANT TO OPEN THE SACK FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND PROFITING BY THEIR ALARM ESCAPE IF THEY TRIED TO CATCH HIM HE WOULD USE HIS KNIFE TO BETTER PURPOSE
7408-255943-0020 IF THEY TOOK HIM TO THE CEMETERY AND LAID HIM IN A GRAVE HE WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE COVERED WITH EARTH AND THEN AS IT WAS NIGHT
7408-255943-0021 AND ESCAPED HE HOPED THAT THE WEIGHT OF EARTH WOULD NOT BE SO GREAT THAT HE COULD NOT OVERCOME IT IF HE WAS DETECTED IN THIS AND THE EARTH PROVED TOO HEAVY HE WOULD BE STIFLED AND THEN SO MUCH THE BETTER ALL WOULD BE OVER
7408-255943-0022 NOR DID HE THINK OF IT NOW HIS SITUATION WAS TOO PRECARIOUS TO ALLOW HIM EVEN TIME TO REFLECT ON ANY THOUGHT BUT ONE THE FIRST RISK THAT DANTES RAN WAS THAT THE JAILER WHEN HE BROUGHT HIM HIS SUPPER AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
7408-255943-0023 MIGHT PERCEIVE THE CHANGE THAT HAD BEEN MADE FORTUNATELY TWENTY TIMES AT LEAST FROM MISANTHROPY OR FATIGUE
7408-255943-0024 THIS TIME THE JAILER MIGHT NOT BE AS SILENT AS USUAL BUT SPEAK TO DANTES AND SEEING THAT HE RECEIVED NO REPLY GO TO THE BED AND THUS DISCOVER ALL WHEN SEVEN O'CLOCK CAME DANTES AGONY REALLY BEGAN
7408-255943-0025 HIS HAND PLACED UPON HIS HEART WAS UNABLE TO REDRESS ITS THROBBINGS WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS TEMPLES FROM TIME TO TIME CHILLS RAN THROUGH HIS WHOLE BODY AND CLUTCHED HIS HEART IN A GRASP OF ICE
7408-255943-0026 THEN HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO DIE YET THE HOURS PASSED ON WITHOUT ANY UNUSUAL DISTURBANCE
7408-255943-0027 IT WAS A GOOD AUGURY AT LENGTH ABOUT THE HOUR THE GOVERNOR HAD APPOINTED FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD ON THE STAIRS EDMOND FELT THAT THE MOMENT HAD ARRIVED SUMMONED UP ALL HIS COURAGE HELD HIS BREATH
7408-255943-0028 THE FOOTSTEPS THEY WERE DOUBLE PAUSED AT THE DOOR AND DANTES GUESSED THAT THE TWO GRAVE DIGGERS HAD COME TO SEEK HIM THIS IDEA WAS SOON CONVERTED INTO CERTAINTY WHEN HE HEARD THE NOISE THEY MADE IN PUTTING DOWN THE HAND BIER
7408-255943-0029 THE DOOR OPENED AND A DIM LIGHT REACHED DANTES EYES THROUGH THE COARSE SACK THAT COVERED HIM HE SAW TWO SHADOWS APPROACH HIS BED A THIRD REMAINING AT THE DOOR WITH A TORCH IN ITS HAND THE TWO MEN APPROACHING THE ENDS OF THE BED TOOK THE SACK BY ITS EXTREMITIES
7408-255943-0030 SAID ANOTHER LIFTING THE FEET HAVE YOU TIED THE KNOT INQUIRED THE FIRST SPEAKER WHAT WOULD BE THE USE OF CARRYING SO MUCH MORE WEIGHT WAS THE REPLY I CAN DO THAT WHEN WE GET THERE YES YOU'RE RIGHT
7408-255943-0031 REPLIED THE COMPANION WHAT'S THE KNOT FOR THOUGHT DANTES THEY DEPOSITED THE SUPPOSED CORPSE ON THE BIER EDMOND STIFFENED HIMSELF IN ORDER TO PLAY THE PART OF A DEAD MAN AND THEN THE PARTY
7408-255943-0032 LIGHTED BY THE MAN WITH THE TORCH WHO WENT FIRST ASCENDED THE STAIRS SUDDENLY HE FELT THE FRESH AND SHARP NIGHT AIR
7408-255943-0033 IT WAS A SENSATION IN WHICH PLEASURE AND PAIN WERE STRANGELY MINGLED THE BEARERS WENT ON FOR TWENTY PACES THEN STOPPED PUTTING THE BIER DOWN ON THE GROUND ONE OF THEM WENT AWAY AND DANTES HEARD HIS SHOES STRIKING ON THE PAVEMENT
7408-255943-0034 WHERE AM I HE ASKED HIMSELF REALLY HE IS BY NO MEANS A LIGHT LOAD SAID THE OTHER BEARER SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE HAND BARROW DANTES FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO ESCAPE BUT FORTUNATELY HE DID NOT ATTEMPT IT
7408-255943-0035 GIVE US A LIGHT SAID THE OTHER BEARER
7408-255943-0036 THE MAN WITH THE TORCH COMPLIED ALTHOUGH NOT ASKED IN THE MOST POLITE TERMS WHAT CAN HE BE LOOKING FOR THOUGHT EDMOND THE SPADE PERHAPS
7408-255943-0037 HERE IT IS AT LAST HE SAID NOT WITHOUT SOME TROUBLE THOUGH YES WAS THE ANSWER BUT IT HAS LOST NOTHING BY WAITING
7408-255943-0038 AS HE SAID THIS THE MAN CAME TOWARDS EDMOND WHO HEARD A HEAVY METALLIC SUBSTANCE LAID DOWN BESIDE HIM AND AT THE SAME MOMENT A CORD WAS FASTENED ROUND HIS FEET WITH SUDDEN AND PAINFUL VIOLENCE WELL HAVE YOU TIED THE KNOT
7408-255943-0039 INQUIRED THE GRAVE DIGGER WHO WAS LOOKING ON YES AND PRETTY TIGHT TOO I CAN TELL YOU WAS THE ANSWER MOVE ON THEN AND THE BIER WAS LIFTED ONCE MORE AND THEY PROCEEDED
7408-255943-0040 THEY ADVANCED FIFTY PACES FARTHER AND THEN STOPPED TO OPEN A DOOR THEN WENT FORWARD AGAIN THE NOISE OF THE WAVES DASHING AGAINST THE ROCKS ON WHICH THE CHATEAU IS BUILT REACHED DANTES EAR DISTINCTLY AS THEY WENT FORWARD BAD WEATHER
7408-255943-0041 OBSERVED ONE OF THE BEARERS NOT A PLEASANT NIGHT FOR A DIP IN THE SEA WHY YES THE ABBE RUNS A CHANCE OF BEING WET SAID THE OTHER AND THEN THERE WAS A BURST OF BRUTAL LAUGHTER
7408-255943-0042 DANTES DID NOT COMPREHEND THE JEST BUT HIS HAIR STOOD ERECT ON HIS HEAD WELL HERE WE ARE AT LAST SAID ONE OF THEM A LITTLE FARTHER A LITTLE FARTHER SAID THE OTHER YOU KNOW VERY WELL
7408-255943-0043 THAT THE LAST WAS STOPPED ON HIS WAY DASHED ON THE ROCKS AND THE GOVERNOR TOLD US NEXT DAY THAT WE WERE CARELESS FELLOWS THEY ASCENDED FIVE OR SIX MORE STEPS AND THEN DANTES FELT THAT THEY TOOK HIM
7408-255943-0044 ONE BY THE HEAD AND THE OTHER BY THE HEELS AND SWUNG HIM TO AND FRO ONE SAID THE GRAVE DIGGERS TWO THREE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT DANTES FELT HIMSELF FLUNG INTO THE AIR LIKE A WOUNDED BIRD
7408-255943-0045 FALLING WITH A RAPIDITY THAT MADE HIS BLOOD CURDLE ALTHOUGH DRAWN DOWNWARDS BY THE HEAVY WEIGHT WHICH HASTENED HIS RAPID DESCENT
7408-255943-0046 AT LAST WITH A HORRIBLE SPLASH HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW INTO THE ICE COLD WATER
7408-255943-0047 STIFLED IN A MOMENT BY HIS IMMERSION BENEATH THE WAVES DANTES HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO THE SEA AND WAS DRAGGED INTO ITS DEPTHS BY A THIRTY SIX POUND SHOT TIED TO HIS FEET THE SEA
