1674-142277-0001 LEAD HER FROM THE FESTIVE BOARDS POINT HER TO THE STARRY SKIES GUARD HER BY YOUR TRUTHFUL WORDS PURE FROM COURTSHIP'S FLATTERIES MISSUS BROWNING MISTER HENRY LENNOX
1674-142277-0002 I AM SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR COMING
1674-142277-0003 ASKED HE IN A LOWER TONE THAN THAT IN WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN
1674-142277-0004 OUR YOUNG COUPLE WERE PLAYING SUCH FOOLISH PRANKS RUNNING ALL SORTS OF RISKS CLIMBING THIS MOUNTAIN SAILING ON THAT LAKE THAT I REALLY THOUGHT THEY NEEDED A MENTOR TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND INDEED THEY DID THEY WERE QUITE BEYOND MY UNCLE'S MANAGEMENT
1674-142277-0005 INDEED WHEN I ONCE SAW HOW UNFIT THEY WERE TO BE TRUSTED ALONE I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY NOT TO LEAVE THEM TILL I HAD SEEN THEM SAFELY EMBARKED AT PLYMOUTH HAVE YOU BEEN AT PLYMOUTH OH EDITH NEVER NAMED THAT TO BE SURE
1674-142277-0006 SHE HAS WRITTEN IN SUCH A HURRY LATELY DID THEY REALLY SAIL ON TUESDAY REALLY SAILED AND RELIEVED ME FROM MANY RESPONSIBILITIES EDITH GAVE ME ALL SORTS OF MESSAGES FOR YOU I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE DIMINUTIVE NOTE SOMEWHERE YES
1674-142277-0007 HERE IT IS OH THANK YOU EXCLAIMED MARGARET AND THEN HALF WISHING TO READ IT ALONE AND UNWATCHED SHE MADE THE EXCUSE OF GOING TO TELL HER MOTHER AGAIN SARAH SURELY HAD MADE SOME MISTAKE THAT MISTER LENNOX WAS THERE
1674-142277-0008 WHEN SHE HAD LEFT THE ROOM HE BEGAN IN HIS SCRUTINISING WAY TO LOOK ABOUT HIM
1674-142277-0009 THE MIDDLE WINDOW IN THE BOW WAS OPENED AND CLUSTERING ROSES AND THE SCARLET HONEYSUCKLE CAME PEEPING ROUND THE CORNER THE SMALL LAWN WAS GORGEOUS WITH VERBENAS AND GERANIUMS OF ALL BRIGHT COLOURS BUT THE VERY BRIGHTNESS OUTSIDE
1674-142277-0010 MADE THE COLOURS WITHIN SEEM POOR AND FADED THE CARPET WAS FAR FROM NEW THE CHINTZ HAD BEEN OFTEN WASHED THE WHOLE APARTMENT WAS SMALLER AND SHABBIER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED AS BACK GROUND AND FRAME WORK FOR MARGARET HERSELF SO QUEENLY
1674-142277-0011 HE TOOK UP ONE OF THE BOOKS LYING ON THE TABLE IT WAS THE PARADISO OF DANTE IN THE PROPER OLD ITALIAN BINDING OF WHITE VELLUM AND GOLD BY IT LAY A DICTIONARY AND SOME WORDS COPIED OUT IN MARGARET'S HAND WRITING THEY WERE A DULL LIST OF WORDS
1674-142277-0012 BUT SOMEHOW HE LIKED LOOKING AT THEM HE PUT THEM DOWN WITH A SIGH THE LIVING IS EVIDENTLY AS SMALL AS SHE SAID IT SEEMS STRANGE FOR THE BERESFORDS BELONG TO A GOOD FAMILY MARGARET MEANWHILE
1674-142277-0013 HAD FOUND HER MOTHER IT WAS ONE OF MISSUS HALE'S FITFUL DAYS WHEN EVERYTHING WAS A DIFFICULTY AND A HARDSHIP AND MISTER LENNOX'S APPEARANCE TOOK THIS SHAPE ALTHOUGH SECRETLY SHE FELT COMPLIMENTED BY HIS THINKING IT WORTH WHILE TO CALL IT IS MOST UNFORTUNATE
1674-142277-0014 AND YET OF COURSE WE MUST ASK HIM TO DINNER EDITH'S BROTHER IN LAW AND ALL
1674-142277-0015 I TOLD HIM I WAS SURE HELSTONE AIR DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM ANY MORE THAN WITH ME AND HE SUDDENLY LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND BEGGED ME NOT TO SPEAK A WORD MORE AGAINST HELSTONE HE COULD NOT BEAR IT IF THERE WAS ONE PLACE HE LOVED ON EARTH IT WAS HELSTONE
1674-142277-0016 IT IS THE DAMP AND RELAXING AIR MARGARET FELT AS IF A THIN COLD CLOUD HAD COME BETWEEN HER AND THE SUN SHE HAD LISTENED PATIENTLY IN HOPES THAT IT MIGHT BE SOME RELIEF TO HER MOTHER TO UNBURDEN HERSELF
1674-142277-0017 BUT NOW IT WAS TIME TO DRAW HER BACK TO MISTER LENNOX PAPA LIKES MISTER LENNOX
1674-142277-0018 I DARE SAY HIS COMING WILL DO PAPA GOOD AND NEVER MIND THE DINNER DEAR MAMMA COLD MEAT WILL DO CAPITALLY FOR A LUNCH WHICH IS THE LIGHT IN WHICH MISTER LENNOX WILL MOST LIKELY LOOK UPON A TWO O'CLOCK DINNER
1674-142277-0019 I'LL ASK HIM TO GO OUT SKETCHING WITH ME I KNOW HE DRAWS AND THAT WILL TAKE HIM OUT OF YOUR WAY MAMMA ONLY DO COME IN NOW HE WILL THINK IT SO STRANGE IF YOU DON'T MISSUS HALE TOOK OFF HER BLACK SILK APRON AND SMOOTHED HER FACE
1674-142277-0020 SHE LOOKED A VERY PRETTY LADY LIKE WOMAN AS SHE GREETED MISTER LENNOX WITH THE CORDIALITY DUE TO ONE WHO WAS ALMOST A RELATION HE EVIDENTLY EXPECTED TO BE ASKED TO SPEND THE DAY
1674-142277-0021 AND ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH A GLAD READINESS THAT MADE MISSUS HALE WISH SHE COULD ADD SOMETHING TO THE COLD BEEF HE WAS PLEASED WITH EVERYTHING DELIGHTED WITH MARGARET'S IDEA OF GOING OUT SKETCHING TOGETHER WOULD NOT HAVE MISTER HALE DISTURBED FOR THE WORLD WITH THE PROSPECT OF SO SOON MEETING HIM AT DINNER
1674-142277-0022 MARGARET BROUGHT OUT HER DRAWING MATERIALS FOR HIM TO CHOOSE FROM AND AFTER THE PAPER AND BRUSHES HAD BEEN DULY SELECTED THE TWO SET OUT IN THE MERRIEST SPIRITS IN THE WORLD NOW PLEASE
1674-142277-0023 JUST STOP HERE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SAID MARGARET THESE ARE THE COTTAGES THAT HAUNTED ME SO DURING THE RAINY FORTNIGHT REPROACHING ME FOR NOT HAVING SKETCHED THEM
1674-142277-0024 WE HAD BETTER NOT PUT IT OFF TILL NEXT YEAR BUT WHERE SHALL WE SIT
1674-142277-0025 LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL TRUNK OF A TREE WHICH THE WOOD CUTTERS HAVE LEFT JUST IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THE LIGHT I WILL PUT MY PLAID OVER IT AND IT WILL BE A REGULAR FOREST THRONE WITH YOUR FEET IN THAT PUDDLE FOR A REGAL FOOTSTOOL
1674-142277-0026 STAY I WILL MOVE AND THEN YOU CAN COME NEARER THIS WAY WHO LIVES IN THESE COTTAGES THEY WERE BUILT BY SQUATTERS FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS AGO ONE IS UNINHABITED THE FORESTERS ARE GOING TO TAKE IT DOWN AS SOON AS THE OLD MAN WHO LIVES IN THE OTHER IS DEAD
1674-142277-0027 POOR OLD FELLOW LOOK THERE HE IS I MUST GO AND SPEAK TO HIM HE IS SO DEAF YOU WILL HEAR ALL OUR SECRETS THE OLD MAN STOOD BAREHEADED IN THE SUN LEANING ON HIS STICK AT THE FRONT OF HIS COTTAGE
1674-142277-0028 HIS STIFF FEATURES RELAXED INTO A SLOW SMILE AS MARGARET WENT UP AND SPOKE TO HIM MISTER LENNOX HASTILY INTRODUCED THE TWO FIGURES INTO HIS SKETCH AND FINISHED UP THE LANDSCAPE WITH A SUBORDINATE REFERENCE TO THEM AS MARGARET PERCEIVED WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR GETTING UP
1674-142277-0029 PUTTING AWAY WATER AND SCRAPS OF PAPER AND EXHIBITING TO EACH OTHER THEIR SKETCHES SHE LAUGHED AND BLUSHED MISTER LENNOX WATCHED HER COUNTENANCE NOW I CALL THAT TREACHEROUS SAID SHE I LITTLE THOUGHT YOU WERE MAKING OLD ISAAC AND ME INTO SUBJECTS
1674-142277-0030 SHE CAME BACK RATHER FLUSHED BUT LOOKING PERFECTLY INNOCENT AND UNCONSCIOUS HE WAS GLAD OF IT FOR THE SPEECH HAD SLIPPED FROM HIM UNAWARES A RARE THING IN THE CASE OF A MAN WHO PREMEDITATED HIS ACTIONS SO MUCH AS HENRY LENNOX
1674-142277-0031 MISTER HALE HAD RETURNED FROM HIS MORNING'S ROUND AND WAS AWAITING HIS VISITOR JUST OUTSIDE THE WICKET GATE THAT LED INTO THE GARDEN HE LOOKED A COMPLETE GENTLEMAN IN HIS RATHER THREADBARE COAT AND WELL WORN HAT MARGARET WAS PROUD OF HER FATHER
1674-142277-0032 MISTER HALE ASKED TO LOOK AT THEIR SKETCHES I THINK YOU HAVE MADE THE TINTS ON THE THATCH TOO DARK HAVE YOU NOT AS HE RETURNED MARGARET'S TO HER AND HELD OUT HIS HAND FOR MISTER LENNOX'S WHICH WAS WITHHELD FROM HIM ONE MOMENT NO MORE
1674-142277-0033 NO PAPA I DON'T THINK I HAVE THE HOUSE LEEK AND STONE CROP HAVE GROWN SO MUCH DARKER IN THE RAIN IS IT NOT LIKE PAPA SAID SHE PEEPING OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE LOOKED AT THE FIGURES IN MISTER LENNOX'S DRAWING YES VERY LIKE
1674-142277-0034 I SHOULD SAY THAT A LIKENESS YOU VERY MUCH WISH TO TAKE YOU WOULD ALWAYS SUCCEED IN SAID MISTER LENNOX I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN THE POWER OF WILL I THINK MYSELF I HAVE SUCCEEDED PRETTY WELL IN YOURS
1674-142277-0035 MISTER HALE HAD PRECEDED THEM INTO THE HOUSE WHILE MARGARET WAS LINGERING TO PLUCK SOME ROSES WITH WHICH TO ADORN HER MORNING GOWN FOR DINNER A REGULAR LONDON GIRL WOULD UNDERSTAND THE IMPLIED MEANING OF THAT SPEECH THOUGHT MISTER LENNOX
1674-142277-0036 BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MARGARET STAY EXCLAIMED HE LET ME HELP YOU AND HE GATHERED FOR HER SOME VELVETY CRAMOISY ROSES THAT WERE ABOVE HER REACH AND THEN DIVIDING THE SPOIL HE PLACED TWO IN HIS BUTTON HOLE
1674-142277-0037 AND SENT HER IN PLEASED AND HAPPY TO ARRANGE HER FLOWERS THE CONVERSATION AT DINNER FLOWED ON QUIETLY AND AGREEABLY THERE WERE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED ON BOTH SIDES
1674-142277-0038 THE LATEST INTELLIGENCE WHICH EACH COULD GIVE OF MISSUS SHAW'S MOVEMENTS IN ITALY TO BE EXCHANGED AND IN THE INTEREST OF WHAT WAS SAID THE UNPRETENDING SIMPLICITY OF THE PARSONAGE WAYS ABOVE ALL IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MARGARET
1674-142277-0039 THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN BUT THE SIMPLE TRUTH WHEN SHE HAD DESCRIBED HER FATHER'S LIVING AS VERY SMALL MARGARET MY CHILD YOU MIGHT HAVE GATHERED US SOME PEARS FOR OUR DESSERT SAID MISTER HALE
1674-142277-0040 AS THE HOSPITABLE LUXURY OF A FRESHLY DECANTED BOTTLE OF WINE WAS PLACED ON THE TABLE MISSUS HALE WAS HURRIED IT SEEMED AS IF DESSERTS WERE IMPROMPTU AND UNUSUAL THINGS AT THE PARSONAGE
1674-142277-0041 I PROPOSE THAT WE ADJOURN INTO THE GARDEN AND EAT THEM THERE SAID MISTER LENNOX NOTHING IS SO DELICIOUS AS TO SET ONE'S TEETH INTO THE CRISP JUICY FRUIT WARM AND SCENTED BY THE SUN
1674-142277-0042 THE WORST IS THE WASPS ARE IMPUDENT ENOUGH TO DISPUTE IT WITH ONE EVEN AT THE VERY CRISIS AND SUMMIT OF ENJOYMENT HE ROSE AS IF TO FOLLOW MARGARET WHO HAD DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE WINDOW HE ONLY AWAITED MISSUS HALE'S PERMISSION
1674-142277-0043 SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE WOUND UP THE DINNER IN THE PROPER WAY AND WITH ALL THE CEREMONIES WHICH HAD GONE ON SO SMOOTHLY HITHERTO ESPECIALLY AS SHE AND DIXON HAD GOT OUT THE FINGER GLASSES FROM THE STORE ROOM ON PURPOSE TO BE AS CORRECT AS BECAME GENERAL SHAW'S WIDOW'S SISTER BUT
1674-142277-0044 AS MISTER HALE GOT UP DIRECTLY AND PREPARED TO ACCOMPANY HIS GUEST SHE COULD ONLY SUBMIT I SHALL ARM MYSELF WITH A KNIFE SAID MISTER HALE THE DAYS OF EATING FRUIT SO PRIMITIVELY AS YOU DESCRIBE ARE OVER WITH ME
1674-142277-0045 I MUST PARE IT AND QUARTER IT BEFORE I CAN ENJOY IT MARGARET MADE A PLATE FOR THE PEARS OUT OF A BEETROOT LEAF
1674-142277-0046 MISTER LENNOX LOOKED MORE AT HER THAN AT THE PEARS BUT HER FATHER INCLINED TO CULL FASTIDIOUSLY THE VERY ZEST AND PERFECTION OF THE HOUR HE HAD STOLEN FROM HIS ANXIETY CHOSE DAINTILY THE RIPEST FRUIT
1674-142277-0047 AND SAT DOWN ON THE GARDEN BENCH TO ENJOY IT AT HIS LEISURE MARGARET AND MISTER LENNOX STROLLED ALONG THE LITTLE TERRACE WALK UNDER THE SOUTH WALL WHERE THE BEES STILL HUMMED AND WORKED BUSILY IN THEIR HIVES WHAT A PERFECT LIFE YOU SEEM TO LIVE HERE
1674-142277-0048 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT RATHER CONTEMPTUOUSLY TOWARDS THE POETS BEFORE WITH THEIR WISHES MINE BE A COT BESIDE A HILL
1674-142277-0049 JUST NOW I FEEL AS IF TWENTY YEARS HARD STUDY OF LAW WOULD BE AMPLY REWARDED BY ONE YEAR OF SUCH AN EXQUISITE SERENE LIFE AS THIS SUCH SKIES LOOKING UP
1674-142277-0050 CRIMSON AND AMBER FOLIAGE SO PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS AS THAT POINTING TO SOME OF THE GREAT FOREST TREES WHICH SHUT IN THE GARDEN AS IF IT WERE A NEST YOU MUST
1674-142277-0051 THOUGH I THINK HELSTONE IS ABOUT AS PERFECT A PLACE AS ANY IN THE WORLD RECOLLECT HOW YOU RATHER SCORNED MY DESCRIPTION OF IT ONE EVENING IN HARLEY STREET A VILLAGE IN A TALE SCORNED MARGARET
1674-142277-0052 AND YOU WHAT MUST I CALL IT THEN SPOKE DISRESPECTFULLY OF HELSTONE AS A MERE VILLAGE IN A TALE I WILL NEVER DO SO AGAIN SAID HE WARMLY THEY TURNED THE CORNER OF THE WALK
1674-142277-0053 I COULD ALMOST WISH MARGARET HE STOPPED AND HESITATED IT WAS SO UNUSUAL FOR THE FLUENT LAWYER TO HESITATE THAT MARGARET LOOKED UP AT HIM IN A LITTLE STATE OF QUESTIONING WONDER
1674-142277-0054 BUT IN AN INSTANT FROM WHAT ABOUT HIM SHE COULD NOT TELL SHE WISHED HERSELF BACK WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER ANYWHERE AWAY FROM HIM FOR SHE WAS SURE HE WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING TO WHICH SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT TO REPLY
1674-142277-0055 IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE STRONG PRIDE THAT WAS IN HER CAME TO CONQUER HER SUDDEN AGITATION WHICH SHE HOPED HE HAD NOT PERCEIVED OF COURSE SHE COULD ANSWER AND ANSWER THE RIGHT THING AND IT WAS POOR AND DESPICABLE OF HER TO SHRINK FROM HEARING ANY SPEECH
1674-142277-0056 AS IF SHE HAD NOT POWER TO PUT AN END TO IT WITH HER HIGH MAIDENLY DIGNITY MARGARET SAID HE TAKING HER BY SURPRISE AND GETTING SUDDEN POSSESSION OF HER HAND SO THAT SHE WAS FORCED TO STAND STILL AND LISTEN
1674-142277-0057 DESPISING HERSELF FOR THE FLUTTERING AT HER HEART ALL THE TIME MARGARET
1674-142277-0058 DID NOT SEEM SO PERFECTLY CALM AND HAPPY HERE I HAVE BEEN HOPING FOR THESE THREE MONTHS PAST TO FIND YOU REGRETTING LONDON AND LONDON FRIENDS A LITTLE ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU LISTEN MORE KINDLY
1674-142277-0059 FOR SHE WAS QUIETLY BUT FIRMLY STRIVING TO EXTRICATE HER HAND FROM HIS GRASP TO ONE WHO HAS NOT MUCH TO OFFER IT IS TRUE NOTHING BUT PROSPECTS IN THE FUTURE BUT
1674-142277-0060 WHO DOES LOVE YOU MARGARET ALMOST IN SPITE OF HIMSELF MARGARET HAVE I STARTLED YOU TOO MUCH SPEAK FOR HE SAW HER LIPS QUIVERING ALMOST AS IF SHE WERE GOING TO CRY
1674-142277-0061 SHE MADE A STRONG EFFORT TO BE CALM SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK TILL SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN MASTERING HER VOICE AND THEN SHE SAID I WAS STARTLED I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU CARED FOR ME IN THAT WAY
1674-142277-0062 I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF YOU AS A FRIEND AND PLEASE I WOULD RATHER GO ON THINKING OF YOU SO I DON'T LIKE TO BE SPOKEN TO AS YOU HAVE BEEN DOING I CANNOT ANSWER YOU AS YOU WANT ME TO DO AND YET
1674-142277-0063 I SHOULD FEEL SO SORRY IF I VEXED YOU MARGARET SAID HE LOOKING INTO HER EYES WHICH MET HIS WITH THEIR OPEN STRAIGHT LOOK EXPRESSIVE OF THE UTMOST GOOD FAITH AND RELUCTANCE TO GIVE PAIN
1674-142277-0064 BUT IT SEEMED AS IF THIS QUESTION WOULD BE AN INSULT TO THE PURE SERENITY OF THOSE EYES FORGIVE ME I HAVE BEEN TOO ABRUPT I AM PUNISHED ONLY LET ME HOPE
1674-142277-0065 AGAIN A PAUSE HE COULD NOT END HIS SENTENCE MARGARET REPROACHED HERSELF ACUTELY AS THE CAUSE OF HIS DISTRESS
1674-142277-0066 IT WAS SUCH A PLEASURE TO THINK OF YOU AS A FRIEND BUT I MAY HOPE MAY I NOT MARGARET THAT SOME TIME YOU WILL THINK OF ME AS A LOVER NOT YET I SEE THERE IS NO HURRY BUT SOME TIME
1674-142277-0067 SHE WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO TRYING TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AS IT WAS IN HER OWN HEART BEFORE REPLYING THEN SHE SAID I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF YOU BUT AS A FRIEND
1674-142277-0068 I LIKE TO THINK OF YOU SO BUT I AM SURE I COULD NEVER THINK OF YOU AS ANYTHING ELSE
1674-142277-0069 ALL THIS DISAGREEABLE SHE WAS GOING TO SAY BUT STOPPED SHORT CONVERSATION HAS TAKEN PLACE HE PAUSED BEFORE HE REPLIED THEN IN HIS HABITUAL COLDNESS OF TONE HE ANSWERED
1674-142277-0070 OF COURSE AS YOUR FEELINGS ARE SO DECIDED AND AS THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN SO EVIDENTLY UNPLEASANT TO YOU IT HAD BETTER NOT BE REMEMBERED THAT IS ALL VERY FINE IN THEORY THAT PLAN OF FORGETTING WHATEVER IS PAINFUL BUT IT
1674-142277-0071 WILL BE SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR ME AT LEAST TO CARRY IT INTO EXECUTION YOU ARE VEXED SAID SHE SADLY YET HOW CAN I HELP IT SHE LOOKED SO TRULY GRIEVED AS SHE SAID THIS THAT HE STRUGGLED FOR A MOMENT WITH HIS REAL DISAPPOINTMENT
1674-142277-0072 YOU SHOULD MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR THE MORTIFICATION NOT ONLY OF A LOVER MARGARET BUT OF A MAN NOT GIVEN TO ROMANCE IN GENERAL PRUDENT WORLDLY AS SOME PEOPLE CALL ME WHO HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT OF HIS USUAL HABITS BY THE FORCE OF A
1674-142277-0073 PASSION WELL WE WILL SAY NO MORE OF THAT BUT IN THE ONE OUTLET WHICH HE HAS FORMED FOR THE DEEPER AND BETTER FEELINGS OF HIS NATURE HE MEETS WITH REJECTION AND REPULSE
1674-142277-0074 I SHALL HAVE TO CONSOLE MYSELF WITH SCORNING MY OWN FOLLY A STRUGGLING BARRISTER TO THINK OF MATRIMONY MARGARET COULD NOT ANSWER THIS
1674-142277-0075 HE WAS THE PLEASANTEST MAN THE MOST SYMPATHISING FRIEND THE PERSON OF ALL OTHERS WHO UNDERSTOOD HER BEST IN HARLEY STREET SHE FELT A TINGE OF CONTEMPT MINGLE ITSELF WITH HER PAIN AT HAVING REFUSED HIM HER BEAUTIFUL LIP
1674-142277-0076 CURLED IN A SLIGHT DISDAIN IT WAS WELL THAT HAVING MADE THE ROUND OF THE GARDEN THEY CAME SUDDENLY UPON MISTER HALE WHOSE WHEREABOUTS HAD BEEN QUITE FORGOTTEN BY THEM HE HAD NOT YET FINISHED THE PEAR WHICH HE HAD DELICATELY PEELED IN ONE LONG STRIP OF SILVER PAPER THINNESS
1674-142277-0077 AND WHICH HE WAS ENJOYING IN A DELIBERATE MANNER IT WAS LIKE THE STORY OF THE EASTERN KING WHO DIPPED HIS HEAD INTO A BASIN OF WATER AT THE MAGICIAN'S COMMAND AND ERE HE INSTANTLY TOOK IT OUT WENT THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME MARGARET FELT STUNNED
1674-142277-0078 SHE WAS GRAVE AND LITTLE DISPOSED TO SPEAK FULL OF WONDER WHEN MISTER LENNOX WOULD GO AND ALLOW HER TO RELAX INTO THOUGHT ON THE EVENTS OF THE LAST QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE WAS ALMOST AS ANXIOUS TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE AS SHE WAS FOR HIM TO LEAVE
1674-142277-0079 BUT A FEW MINUTES LIGHT AND CARELESS TALKING CARRIED ON AT WHATEVER EFFORT WAS A SACRIFICE WHICH HE OWED TO HIS MORTIFIED VANITY OR HIS SELF RESPECT HE GLANCED FROM TIME TO TIME AT HER SAD AND PENSIVE FACE
1674-142277-0080 I AM NOT SO INDIFFERENT TO HER AS SHE BELIEVES THOUGHT HE TO HIMSELF I DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE
1674-142277-0081 SPEAKING OF LIFE IN LONDON AND LIFE IN THE COUNTRY AS IF HE WERE CONSCIOUS OF HIS SECOND MOCKING SELF
1674-142277-0082 AND AT DINNER TO DAY A LIGHTER CLEVERER MORE WORLDLY MAN AND AS SUCH DISSONANT TO MISTER HALE IT WAS A RELIEF TO ALL THREE
1674-142277-0083 THEY PROCEEDED TO THE HOUSE TO FIND MISSUS HALE AND WISH HER GOOD BYE AT THE LAST MOMENT HENRY LENNOX'S REAL SELF BROKE THROUGH THE CRUST MARGARET DON'T DESPISE ME I HAVE A HEART NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS
1674-142277-0084 GOOD FOR NOTHING WAY OF TALKING AS A PROOF OF IT I BELIEVE I LOVE YOU MORE THAN EVER IF I DO NOT HATE YOU FOR THE DISDAIN WITH WHICH YOU HAVE LISTENED TO ME DURING THIS LAST HALF HOUR GOOD BYE MARGARET
