7188-104637-0000 CHAPTER SIX LOST IN THE ROSEBUD RANGE
7188-104637-0001 MUTTERED THE LAD STIRRING RESTLESSLY I'LL GET HIM NEXT TIME LOOK OUT HE'S CHARGING US OH THE BOY SUDDENLY OPENED HIS EYES THE DARKNESS ABOUT HIM WAS DEEP AND IMPENETRABLE AND HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A HEAVY WEIGHT ON HIS CHEST
7188-104637-0002 WHAT IT WAS HE DID NOT KNOW AND SOME MOMENTS PASSED
7188-104637-0003 ALL AT ONCE HE RECOLLECTED IT WAS THE BEAR HE MURMURED I WONDER IF I AM DEAD NO HE COULD FEEL THE GROUND UNDER HIM AND A ROCK THAT HIS RIGHT HAND RESTED ON FELT COLD AND CHILLING BUT WHAT OF THE PRESSURE ON HIS CHEST
7188-104637-0004 CAUTIOUSLY THE LAD MOVED A HAND TOWARD THE OBJECT THAT WAS HOLDING HIM DOWN HIS FINGERS LIGHTLY TOUCHED IT TAD COULD SCARCE REPRESS A YELL IT WAS THE HEAD OF THE BEAR
7188-104637-0005 WERE DEAD OR ASLEEP AWAITING THE MOMENT WHEN THE LAD SHOULD STIR AGAIN TO FASTEN ITS CRUEL TEETH INTO HIS BODY THE BOY WAS SATISFIED HOWEVER THAT BY EXERTING ALL HIS STRENGTH HE WOULD BE ABLE TO PULL HIMSELF AWAY
7188-104637-0006 UNDOUBTEDLY IT HAD FALLEN UNDERNEATH THE BEAR TAD DETERMINED TO MATE A DESPERATE EFFORT TO ESCAPE HE FELT AS IF HIS HAIR WERE STANDING ON END WITH A CRY THAT HE COULD NOT KEEP BACK
7188-104637-0007 THE LAD WHIRLED OVER AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET AS HE DID SO HE LEAPED AWAY RUNNING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT UNTIL HE HAD PUT SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE PROSTRATE ANIMAL
7188-104637-0008 TAD BROUGHT UP SHARPLY
7188-104637-0009 THERE HE STOOD LISTENING INTENTLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES NOT A SOUND DISTURBED THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES HUNG LIMP AND LIFELESS FOR NO BREEZE WAS STIRRING I WONDER IF HE'S DEAD
7188-104637-0010 WHISPERED THE LAD ALMOST AFRAID TO TRUST HIS VOICE OUT LOUD MAYBE THAT SHOT FINISHED HIM I MUST FIND OUT SOMEHOW TAD SEARCHED HIS CLOTHES FOR MATCHES FINALLY FINDING HIS MATCH SAFE NEXT HE SOUGHT TO GATHER SOME STICKS
7188-104637-0011 HE PICKED HIS WAY CAREFULLY TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN LYING PEERING INTO THE SHADOWS AHEAD OF HIM SUSPICIOUSLY AS HE WENT THERE HE IS BREATHED TAD HE COULD FAINTLY MAKE OUT THE FIGURE OF THE BEAR LYING HALF ON ITS SIDE AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE
7188-104637-0012 THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THE ANIMAL'S HEAD WAS STRETCHED OUT ON THE GROUND INSTEAD OF ON THE LAD'S CHEST I BELIEVE HE'S DEAD HE MUST BE OR HE'D HAVE BEEN AFTER ME BEFORE THIS DECIDED THE BOY I M GOING TO FIND OUT MUSTERING HIS COURAGE
7188-104637-0013 TAD CONTINUED HIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH LIGHTING MATCH AFTER MATCH SHADING THE FLAME WITH HIS HANDS SO THAT THE LIGHT WOULD NOT GET INTO HIS EYES AND PREVENT HIM FROM SEEING ANYTHING AHEAD OF HIM IT REQUIRED NO LITTLE COURAGE
7188-104637-0014 FOR A BOY ALONE IN THE MOUNTAINS TO WALK UP TO A BEAR NOT KNOWING WHETHER THE ANIMAL WERE DEAD OR ALIVE YET WHEN TAD BUTLER MADE UP HIS MIND TO DO A CERTAIN THING HE PERSISTED UNTIL HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED IT
7188-104637-0015 HE REACHED THE SIDE OF THE ANIMAL THAT IS CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT HE COULD GET A GOOD VIEW OF IT THE BEAR NEVER MOVED AND TAD DREW CLOSER WALKING ON HIS TOES THAT HE MIGHT MAKE NO SOUND
7188-104637-0016 THERE SEEMED NO OTHER WAY TO MAKE CERTAIN EXCEPT TO STIR THE ANIMAL I'LL DO IT WHISPERED TAD CAUTIOUSLY LIGHTING ANOTHER MATCH HE DREW BACK HIS LEFT FOOT AND ADMINISTERED A SOUND KICK
7188-104637-0017 TO THE BEAST'S SIDE THINKING THAT THE BEAR HAD MOVED UNDER THE BLOW TAD WHIRLED AND RAN TITTERING A LOUD OH HE WAITED BUT COULD HEAR NO SOUND I BELIEVE I AM AFRAID OF MYSELF THAT BEAR HASN'T STIRRED AT ALL
7188-104637-0018 THERE WAS NO MOVEMENT OTHER THAN A SLIGHT TREMOR
7188-104637-0019 CRIED THE LAD IN THE EXCESS OF HIS EXCITEMENT I WONDER WHAT THE BOYS WILL SAY THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW AM I GOING TO GET HIM BACK TO CAMP TAD PONDERED OVER THIS PROBLEM SOME MOMENTS I KNOW HE CRIED I'LL HITCH A ROPE TO HIM
7188-104637-0020 BUT WHERE IS THAT PONY
7188-104637-0021 THAT WAS THE LAST HE HAD SEEN OF PINK EYE TAD WHISTLED AND CALLED LISTENING AFTER EACH ATTEMPT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST RESULT HE'S GONE
7188-104637-0022 THE WORST OF IT IS I MAY BE A LONG WAY FROM CAMP BUT I GUESS I CAN FIND MY WAY WITH THE COMPASS ALL RIGHT THE COMPASS HOWEVER WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND THE LAD WENT THROUGH HIS POCKETS TWICE IN SEARCH OF IT
7188-104637-0023 AH THERE IT IS TAD PICKED UP THE WEAPON JOYFULLY
7188-104637-0024 A MOMENT LATER WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT THE WEAPON HELD NOTHING BUT EMPTY SHELLS THE KEEN EDGE OF HIS JOY WAS DULLED
7188-104637-0025 IT'S BETTER TO PACK BACK AN EMPTY GUN THAN NO GUN AT ALL HE DECIDED PHILOSOPHICALLY LET ME SEE I THINK WE CAME UP THAT WAY
7188-104637-0026 THEY'LL BUILD A BIG FIRE SO I CAN SEE IT AND I OUGHT TO BE THERE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR AT LEAST THE LAD STRUCK OUT CONFIDENTLY HE HAD BEEN LOST IN THE WILDERNESS BEFORE AND THOUGH HE FELT A SLIGHT UNEASINESS
7188-104637-0027 HE HAD NO DOUBT OF HIS ABILITY TO FIND THE CAMP EVENTUALLY HE WALKED VIGOROUSLY FOR HALF AN HOUR THEN HE HALTED THE SAME IMPRESSIVE SILENCE SURROUNDED HIM
7188-104637-0028 BEEN GOING A LITTLE TOO FAR TO THE LEFT HE DECIDED HE CHANGED HIS COURSE AND PLODDED ON METHODICALLY AGAIN ANOTHER HALF HOUR PASSED AND ONCE MORE THE LAD PAUSED
7188-104637-0029 TAD UTTERED A LONG DRAWN
7188-104637-0030 E HE LISTENED INTENTLY THEN REPEATED THE CALL THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE ALMOST FRIGHTENED HIM OH I'M
7188-104637-0031 HE CRIED NOW FULLY APPRECIATING HIS POSITION THE PANIC OF THE LOST SEIZED HIM AND TAD RAN THIS WAY AND THAT PLUNGING AHEAD FOR SOME DISTANCE THEN SWERVING TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO FREE HIMSELF
7188-104637-0032 FROM THE ENDLESS THICKET BRUISING HIS BODY FROM CONTACT WITH THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES AND CUTTING HIS HANDS AS THEY STRUCK THE ROCKS VIOLENTLY WHEN HE FELL TAD BUTLER YOU STOP THIS HE COMMANDED STERNLY BRINGING HIMSELF UP SHARPLY
7188-104637-0033 I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE SUCH A SILLY KID AS TO BE AFRAID OF THE DARK BUT IN HIS INNERMOST HEART THE LAD KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT THE SHADOWS THAT HAD SO UPSET HIM IT WAS THE FEELING OF BEING LOST IN AN UNKNOWN FOREST
7188-104637-0034 INSTEAD OF BEING IN THE FOOTHILLS AS HE HAD SUPPOSED HE WAS PENETRATING THE FASTNESSES OF THE ROSEBUD MOUNTAINS THEMSELVES THERE IS NO USE IN MY GOING ON LIKE THIS HE DECIDED FINALLY
7188-104637-0035 I'LL SIT DOWN AND WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT THAT'S ALL I CAN DO I SURELY CAN FIND MY WAY BACK TO CAMP WHEN THE LIGHT COMES AGAIN THE NEXT QUESTION WAS WHERE SHOULD HE GO WHERE
7188-104637-0036 HE HAD HEARD SOME ONE SPEAK OF MOUNTAIN LIONS AND HAVING SEEN THESE BEFORE HE FERVENTLY HOPED HE MIGHT NOT HAVE ANOTHER EXPERIENCE WITH THEM UNARMED AS HE WAS
7188-104637-0037 AFTER SEARCHING AROUND FOR SOME TIME
7188-104637-0038 UP THIS HE CLAMBERED IT WOULD GIVE HIM A GOOD VIEW IN THE MORNING ANYWAY BESIDES PROTECTING HIM FROM ANY PROWLING ANIMALS THAT MIGHT CHANCE IN THAT PART OF THE FOREST TAD ENSCONCED HIMSELF IN A SLIGHT DEPRESSION
7188-104637-0039 AND WITH A FLAT ROCK FOR A RESTING PLACE LEANED BACK DETERMINED TO MAKE THE BEST OF HIS POSITION A GENTLE BREEZE NOW STIRRED THE FOLIAGE ABOVE HIS HEAD AND ALL ABOUT HIM UNTIL THE SOUND BECAME A
7188-104637-0040 HE DECIDED WISELY CASTING A GLANCE ABOVE HIM AT THE SKY WHICH WAS BECOMING RAPIDLY OVERCAST AND I HAVEN'T ANY UMBRELLA HE ADDED GRINNING AT HIS OWN FEEBLE JOKE WELL I'VE BEEN WET BEFORE
7188-104637-0041 ELSE HE WOULD NOW HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE COLD AS IT WAS HE SHIVERED
