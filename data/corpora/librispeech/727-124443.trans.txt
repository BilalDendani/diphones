727-124443-0000 I WANT TO SEE YOUR PATIENT MISTER RENFIELD DO LET ME SEE HIM WHAT YOU HAVE SAID OF HIM IN YOUR DIARY INTERESTS ME SO MUCH SHE LOOKED SO APPEALING AND SO PRETTY THAT I COULD NOT REFUSE HER AND THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE REASON WHY I SHOULD SO I TOOK HER WITH ME
727-124443-0001 WHEN I WENT INTO THE ROOM I TOLD THE MAN THAT A LADY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM TO WHICH HE SIMPLY ANSWERED WHY SHE IS GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE
727-124443-0002 OH VERY WELL HE SAID LET HER COME IN BY ALL MEANS BUT JUST WAIT A MINUTE TILL I TIDY UP THE PLACE HIS METHOD OF TIDYING WAS PECULIAR HE SIMPLY SWALLOWED ALL THE FLIES AND SPIDERS IN THE BOXES BEFORE I COULD STOP HIM IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT HE FEARED
727-124443-0003 OR WAS JEALOUS OF SOME INTERFERENCE
727-124443-0004 HE SAID CHEERFULLY LET THE LADY COME IN AND SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED WITH HIS HEAD DOWN
727-124443-0005 AND I TOOK CARE TO STAND WHERE I COULD SEIZE HIM AT ONCE IF HE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A SPRING AT HER SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM WITH AN EASY GRACEFULNESS WHICH WOULD AT ONCE COMMAND THE RESPECT OF ANY LUNATIC FOR EASINESS IS ONE OF THE QUALITIES MAD PEOPLE MOST RESPECT
727-124443-0006 SHE WALKED OVER TO HIM SMILING PLEASANTLY AND HELD OUT HER HAND GOOD EVENING MISTER RENFIELD SAID SHE YOU SEE I KNOW YOU FOR DOCTOR SEWARD HAS TOLD ME OF YOU HE MADE NO IMMEDIATE REPLY BUT EYED HER ALL OVER INTENTLY WITH A SET FROWN ON HIS FACE
727-124443-0007 THIS LOOK GAVE WAY TO ONE OF WONDER WHICH MERGED IN DOUBT THEN TO MY INTENSE ASTONISHMENT HE SAID YOU'RE NOT THE GIRL THE DOCTOR WANTED TO MARRY ARE YOU YOU CAN'T BE YOU KNOW FOR SHE'S DEAD
727-124443-0008 OH NO I HAVE A HUSBAND OF MY OWN
727-124443-0009 OR HE ME I AM MISSUS HARKER
727-124443-0010 MY HUSBAND AND I ARE STAYING ON A VISIT WITH DOCTOR SEWARD THEN DON'T STAY BUT WHY NOT I THOUGHT THAT THIS STYLE OF CONVERSATION MIGHT NOT BE PLEASANT TO MISSUS HARKER ANY MORE THAN IT WAS TO ME SO I JOINED IN HOW DID YOU KNOW I WANTED TO MARRY ANY ONE
727-124443-0011 HIS REPLY WAS SIMPLY CONTEMPTUOUS GIVEN IN A PAUSE IN WHICH HE TURNED HIS EYES FROM MISSUS HARKER TO ME INSTANTLY TURNING THEM BACK AGAIN WHAT AN ASININE QUESTION I DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL MISTER RENFIELD SAID MISSUS HARKER AT ONCE CHAMPIONING ME
727-124443-0012 YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERSTAND MISSUS HARKER THAT WHEN A MAN IS SO LOVED AND HONOURED AS OUR HOST IS EVERYTHING REGARDING HIM IS OF INTEREST IN OUR LITTLE COMMUNITY
727-124443-0013 BUT EVEN BY HIS PATIENTS WHO BEING SOME OF THEM HARDLY IN MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM
727-124443-0014 SINCE I MYSELF HAVE BEEN AN INMATE OF A LUNATIC ASYLUM I CANNOT BUT NOTICE THAT THE SOPHISTIC TENDENCIES OF SOME OF ITS INMATES LEAN TOWARDS THE ERRORS OF NON CAUSA AND IGNORATIO ELENCHI I POSITIVELY OPENED MY EYES AT THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT
727-124443-0015 HERE WAS MY OWN PET LUNATIC THE MOST PRONOUNCED OF HIS TYPE THAT I HAD EVER MET WITH TALKING ELEMENTAL PHILOSOPHY AND WITH THE MANNER OF A POLISHED GENTLEMAN I WONDER IF IT WAS MISSUS HARKER'S PRESENCE WHICH HAD TOUCHED SOME CHORD IN HIS MEMORY IF THIS NEW PHASE WAS SPONTANEOUS
727-124443-0016 OR IN ANY WAY DUE TO HER UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCE SHE MUST HAVE SOME RARE GIFT OR POWER WE CONTINUED TO TALK FOR SOME TIME AND SEEING THAT HE WAS SEEMINGLY QUITE REASONABLE SHE VENTURED
727-124443-0017 FOR HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE QUESTION WITH THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE COMPLETEST SANITY HE EVEN TOOK HIMSELF AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN HE MENTIONED CERTAIN THINGS WHY I MYSELF AM AN INSTANCE OF A MAN WHO HAD A STRANGE BELIEF
727-124443-0018 INDEED IT WAS NO WONDER THAT MY FRIENDS WERE ALARMED AND INSISTED ON MY BEING PUT UNDER CONTROL I USED TO FANCY THAT LIFE WAS A POSITIVE AND PERPETUAL ENTITY
727-124443-0019 NO MATTER HOW LOW IN THE SCALE OF CREATION ONE MIGHT INDEFINITELY PROLONG LIFE
727-124443-0020 THE DOCTOR HERE WILL BEAR ME OUT THAT ON ONE OCCASION I TRIED TO KILL HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF STRENGTHENING MY VITAL POWERS BY THE ASSIMILATION WITH MY OWN BODY OF HIS LIFE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HIS BLOOD RELYING OF COURSE UPON THE SCRIPTURAL PHRASE FOR THE BLOOD IS THE LIFE THOUGH INDEED THE VENDOR OF A CERTAIN NOSTRUM
727-124443-0021 HAS VULGARISED THE TRUISM TO THE VERY POINT OF CONTEMPT ISN'T THAT TRUE DOCTOR I NODDED ASSENT FOR I WAS SO AMAZED THAT I HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO EITHER THINK OR SAY IT WAS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT I HAD SEEN HIM EAT UP HIS SPIDERS AND FLIES NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE
727-124443-0022 SHE CAME AT ONCE AFTER SAYING PLEASANTLY TO MISTER RENFIELD GOOD BYE
727-124443-0023 UNDER AUSPICES PLEASANTER TO YOURSELF TO WHICH TO MY ASTONISHMENT HE REPLIED GOOD BYE MY DEAR I PRAY GOD I MAY NEVER SEE YOUR SWEET FACE AGAIN MAY HE BLESS AND KEEP YOU
727-124443-0024 I LEFT THE BOYS BEHIND ME POOR ART SEEMED MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAS BEEN SINCE LUCY FIRST TOOK ILL AND QUINCEY IS MORE LIKE HIS OWN BRIGHT SELF THAN HE HAS BEEN FOR MANY A LONG DAY
727-124443-0025 HE SAW ME AT ONCE AND RUSHED UP TO ME SAYING AH FRIEND JOHN HOW GOES ALL WELL SO I HAVE BEEN BUSY FOR I COME HERE TO STAY IF NEED BE ALL AFFAIRS ARE SETTLED WITH ME AND I HAVE MUCH TO TELL MADAM MINA IS WITH YOU YES
727-124443-0026 AND HER SO FINE HUSBAND AND ARTHUR AND MY FRIEND QUINCEY THEY ARE WITH YOU TOO GOOD AS I DROVE TO THE HOUSE I TOLD HIM OF WHAT HAD PASSED AND OF HOW MY OWN DIARY HAD COME TO BE OF SOME USE THROUGH MISSUS HARKER'S SUGGESTION AT WHICH THE PROFESSOR INTERRUPTED ME
727-124443-0027 AH THAT WONDERFUL MADAM MINA
727-124443-0028 A BRAIN THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE WERE HE MUCH GIFTED AND A WOMAN'S HEART
727-124443-0029 WHEN HE MADE THAT SO GOOD COMBINATION FRIEND JOHN UP TO NOW FORTUNE HAS MADE THAT WOMAN OF HELP TO US AFTER TO NIGHT SHE MUST NOT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS SO TERRIBLE AFFAIR IT IS NOT GOOD THAT SHE RUN A RISK SO GREAT WE MEN ARE DETERMINED NAY
727-124443-0030 ARE WE NOT PLEDGED TO DESTROY THIS MONSTER
727-124443-0031 EVEN IF SHE BE NOT HARMED HER HEART MAY FAIL HER IN SO MUCH AND SO MANY HORRORS AND HEREAFTER SHE MAY SUFFER
727-124443-0032 AND IN SLEEP FROM HER DREAMS AND BESIDES SHE IS YOUNG WOMAN AND NOT SO LONG MARRIED THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS TO THINK OF SOME TIME IF NOT NOW YOU TELL ME SHE HAS WROTE ALL THEN SHE MUST CONSULT WITH US
727-124443-0033 AND WE GO ALONE I AGREED HEARTILY WITH HIM
727-124443-0034 THAT THE HOUSE WHICH DRACULA HAD BOUGHT WAS THE VERY NEXT ONE TO MY OWN HE WAS AMAZED AND A GREAT CONCERN SEEMED TO COME ON HIM OH THAT WE HAD KNOWN IT BEFORE HE SAID FOR THEN WE MIGHT HAVE REACHED HIM IN TIME TO SAVE POOR LUCY HOWEVER
727-124443-0035 THE MILK THAT IS SPILT CRIES NOT OUT AFTERWARDS AS YOU SAY WE SHALL NOT THINK OF THAT BUT GO ON OUR WAY TO THE END
727-124443-0036 HE SAID TO MISSUS HARKER I AM TOLD MADAM MINA BY MY FRIEND JOHN THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND HAVE PUT UP IN EXACT ORDER ALL THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN UP TO THIS MOMENT NOT UP TO THIS MOMENT PROFESSOR SHE SAID IMPULSIVELY BUT UP TO THIS MORNING BUT WHY NOT UP TO NOW
727-124443-0037 WE HAVE TOLD OUR SECRETS AND YET NO ONE WHO HAS TOLD IS THE WORSE FOR IT MISSUS HARKER BEGAN TO BLUSH

727-124443-0039 THE PROFESSOR READ IT OVER GRAVELY AND HANDED IT BACK SAYING IT NEED NOT GO IN IF YOU DO NOT WISH IT
727-124443-0040 IT CAN BUT MAKE YOUR HUSBAND LOVE YOU THE MORE AND ALL US YOUR FRIENDS MORE HONOUR YOU AS WELL AS MORE ESTEEM AND LOVE SHE TOOK IT BACK WITH ANOTHER BLUSH AND A BRIGHT SMILE AND SO NOW UP TO THIS VERY HOUR ALL THE RECORDS WE HAVE ARE COMPLETE AND IN ORDER

727-124443-0042 WITH THIS TERRIBLE AND MYSTERIOUS ENEMY MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL THIRTY SEPTEMBER
727-124443-0043 WHICH HAD BEEN AT SIX O'CLOCK WE UNCONSCIOUSLY FORMED A SORT OF BOARD OR COMMITTEE PROFESSOR VAN HELSING TOOK THE HEAD OF THE TABLE TO WHICH DOCTOR SEWARD MOTIONED HIM AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM HE MADE ME SIT NEXT TO HIM ON HIS RIGHT AND ASKED ME TO ACT AS SECRETARY JONATHAN SAT NEXT TO ME
727-124443-0044 OPPOSITE US WERE LORD GODALMING DOCTOR SEWARD AND MISTER MORRIS LORD GODALMING BEING NEXT THE PROFESSOR AND DOCTOR SEWARD IN THE CENTRE THE PROFESSOR SAID I MAY I SUPPOSE TAKE IT THAT WE ARE ALL ACQUAINTED WITH THE FACTS THAT ARE IN THESE PAPERS
727-124443-0045 WE ALL EXPRESSED ASSENT AND HE WENT ON THEN IT WERE I THINK GOOD THAT I TELL YOU SOMETHING OF THE KIND OF ENEMY WITH WHICH WE HAVE TO DEAL I SHALL THEN MAKE KNOWN TO YOU SOMETHING OF THE HISTORY OF THIS MAN WHICH HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED FOR ME
727-124443-0046 AND CAN TAKE OUR MEASURE ACCORDING THERE ARE SUCH BEINGS AS VAMPIRES SOME OF US HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THEY EXIST EVEN HAD WE NOT THE PROOF OF OUR OWN UNHAPPY EXPERIENCE THE TEACHINGS AND THE RECORDS OF THE PAST GIVE PROOF ENOUGH FOR SANE PEOPLES I ADMIT
727-124443-0047 THAT AT THE FIRST I WAS SCEPTIC WERE IT NOT THAT THROUGH LONG YEARS I HAVE TRAIN MYSELF TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THAT FACT THUNDER ON MY EAR SEE SEE I PROVE I PROVE ALAS
727-124443-0048 NAY HAD I EVEN GUESS AT HIM ONE SO PRECIOUS LIFE HAD BEEN SPARED TO MANY OF US WHO DID LOVE HER BUT THAT IS GONE AND WE MUST SO WORK THAT OTHER POOR SOULS PERISH NOT WHILST WE CAN SAVE THE NOSFERATU DO NOT DIE LIKE THE BEE WHEN HE STING ONCE
727-124443-0049 HE IS ONLY STRONGER AND BEING STRONGER HAVE YET MORE POWER TO WORK EVIL
727-124443-0050 WHICH IS AS HIS ETYMOLOGY IMPLY
727-124443-0051 AND ALL THE DEAD THAT HE CAN COME NIGH TO ARE FOR HIM AT COMMAND HE IS BRUTE AND MORE THAN BRUTE
727-124443-0052 HE MUST SURELY WIN AND THEN WHERE END WE LIFE IS NOTHINGS I HEED HIM NOT BUT TO FAIL HERE IS NOT MERE LIFE OR DEATH IT IS THAT WE BECOME AS HIM THAT WE HENCEFORWARD BECOME FOUL THINGS OF THE NIGHT LIKE HIM
727-124443-0053 WITHOUT HEART OR CONSCIENCE PREYING ON THE BODIES AND THE SOULS OF THOSE WE LOVE BEST TO US FOR EVER ARE THE GATES OF HEAVEN SHUT FOR WHO SHALL OPEN THEM TO US AGAIN WE GO ON FOR ALL TIME ABHORRED BY ALL A BLOT ON THE FACE OF GOD'S SUNSHINE
727-124443-0054 AN ARROW IN THE SIDE OF HIM WHO DIED FOR MAN BUT WE ARE FACE TO FACE WITH DUTY
727-124443-0055 AND LIFE WITH HIS SUNSHINE HIS FAIR PLACES
727-124443-0056 HIS MUSIC AND HIS LOVE LIE FAR BEHIND YOU OTHERS ARE YOUNG SOME HAVE SEEN SORROW
727-124443-0057 WHAT SAY YOU WHILST HE WAS SPEAKING JONATHAN HAD TAKEN MY HAND I FEARED OH SO MUCH THAT THE APPALLING NATURE OF OUR DANGER WAS OVERCOMING HIM
727-124443-0058 BUT IT WAS LIFE TO ME TO FEEL ITS TOUCH SO STRONG SO SELF RELIANT SO RESOLUTE A BRAVE MAN'S HAND CAN SPEAK FOR ITSELF IT DOES NOT EVEN NEED A WOMAN'S LOVE TO HEAR ITS MUSIC WHEN THE PROFESSOR HAD DONE SPEAKING
727-124443-0059 AND I IN HIS THERE WAS NO NEED FOR SPEAKING BETWEEN US I ANSWER FOR MINA AND MYSELF HE SAID COUNT ME IN PROFESSOR SAID MISTER QUINCEY MORRIS LACONICALLY AS USUAL I AM WITH YOU SAID LORD GODALMING FOR LUCY'S SAKE IF FOR NO OTHER REASON
727-124443-0060 THE PROFESSOR STOOD UP AND AFTER LAYING HIS GOLDEN CRUCIFIX ON THE TABLE HELD OUT HIS HAND ON EITHER SIDE I TOOK HIS RIGHT HAND AND LORD GODALMING HIS LEFT JONATHAN HELD MY RIGHT WITH HIS LEFT AND STRETCHED ACROSS TO MISTER MORRIS
727-124443-0061 SO AS WE ALL TOOK HANDS OUR SOLEMN COMPACT WAS MADE I FELT MY HEART ICY COLD
727-124443-0062 WE RESUMED OUR PLACES AND DOCTOR VAN HELSING WENT ON WITH A SORT OF CHEERFULNESS WHICH SHOWED THAT THE SERIOUS WORK HAD BEGUN IT WAS TO BE TAKEN AS GRAVELY AND IN AS BUSINESSLIKE A WAY AS ANY OTHER TRANSACTION OF LIFE WELL
727-124443-0063 YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO CONTEND AGAINST BUT WE TOO ARE NOT WITHOUT STRENGTH
727-124443-0064 A POWER DENIED TO THE VAMPIRE KIND WE HAVE SOURCES OF SCIENCE WE ARE FREE TO ACT AND THINK AND THE HOURS OF THE DAY AND THE NIGHT ARE OURS EQUALLY IN FACT SO FAR AS OUR POWERS EXTEND THEY ARE UNFETTERED AND WE ARE FREE TO USE THEM WE HAVE SELF DEVOTION IN A CAUSE
727-124443-0065 AND AN END TO ACHIEVE WHICH IS NOT A SELFISH ONE THESE THINGS ARE MUCH NOW LET US SEE HOW FAR THE GENERAL POWERS ARRAYED AGAINST US ARE RESTRICT AND HOW THE INDIVIDUAL CANNOT IN FINE LET US CONSIDER THE LIMITATIONS OF THE VAMPIRE IN GENERAL
727-124443-0066 ALL WE HAVE TO GO UPON ARE TRADITIONS AND SUPERSTITIONS THESE DO NOT AT THE FIRST APPEAR MUCH WHEN THE MATTER IS ONE OF LIFE AND DEATH
727-124443-0067 YET MUST WE BE SATISFIED IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE NO OTHER MEANS IS AT OUR CONTROL AND SECONDLY BECAUSE AFTER ALL THESE THINGS TRADITION AND SUPERSTITION
727-124443-0068 DOES NOT THE BELIEF IN VAMPIRES REST FOR OTHERS THOUGH NOT ALAS FOR US ON THEM A YEAR AGO WHICH OF US WOULD HAVE RECEIVED SUCH A POSSIBILITY IN THE MIDST OF OUR SCIENTIFIC SCEPTICAL
727-124443-0069 WE EVEN SCOUTED A BELIEF THAT WE SAW JUSTIFIED UNDER OUR VERY EYES TAKE IT THEN THAT THE VAMPIRE
727-124443-0070 FOR LET ME TELL YOU HE IS KNOWN EVERYWHERE THAT MEN HAVE BEEN IN OLD GREECE IN OLD ROME HE FLOURISH IN GERMANY ALL OVER IN FRANCE IN INDIA EVEN IN THE CHERNOSESE AND IN CHINA
727-124443-0071 SO FAR FROM US IN ALL WAYS THERE EVEN IS HE AND THE PEOPLES FEAR HIM AT THIS DAY HE HAVE FOLLOW THE WAKE OF THE BERSERKER ICELANDER THE DEVIL BEGOTTEN HUN THE SLAV THE SAXON THE MAGYAR SO FAR THEN
727-124443-0072 WE HAVE ALL WE MAY ACT UPON AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT VERY MUCH OF THE BELIEFS ARE JUSTIFIED BY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR OWN SO UNHAPPY EXPERIENCE THE VAMPIRE LIVE ON AND CANNOT DIE BY MERE PASSING OF THE TIME
727-124443-0073 HE CAN FLOURISH WHEN THAT HE CAN FATTEN ON THE BLOOD OF THE LIVING EVEN MORE
727-124443-0074 THAT HIS VITAL FACULTIES GROW STRENUOUS AND SEEM AS THOUGH THEY REFRESH THEMSELVES WHEN HIS SPECIAL PABULUM IS PLENTY BUT HE CANNOT FLOURISH WITHOUT THIS DIET HE EAT NOT AS OTHERS EVEN FRIEND JONATHAN WHO LIVED WITH HIM FOR WEEKS
727-124443-0075 NEVER HE THROWS NO SHADOW HE MAKE IN THE MIRROR NO REFLECT AS AGAIN JONATHAN OBSERVE HE HAS THE STRENGTH OF MANY OF HIS HAND WITNESS AGAIN JONATHAN WHEN HE SHUT THE DOOR AGAINST THE WOLFS AND WHEN HE HELP HIM FROM THE DILIGENCE TOO
727-124443-0076 HE CAN TRANSFORM HIMSELF TO WOLF AS WE GATHER FROM THE SHIP ARRIVAL IN WHITBY WHEN HE TEAR OPEN THE DOG
727-124443-0077 AS MADAM MINA SAW HIM ON THE WINDOW AT WHITBY AND AS FRIEND JOHN SAW HIM FLY FROM THIS SO NEAR HOUSE AND AS MY FRIEND QUINCEY SAW HIM
727-124443-0078 HE CAN COME IN MIST WHICH HE CREATE THAT NOBLE SHIP'S CAPTAIN PROVED HIM OF THIS BUT FROM WHAT WE KNOW THE DISTANCE HE CAN MAKE THIS MIST IS LIMITED AND IT CAN ONLY BE ROUND HIMSELF HE COME ON MOONLIGHT RAYS AS ELEMENTAL DUST
727-124443-0079 AS AGAIN JONATHAN SAW THOSE SISTERS IN THE CASTLE OF DRACULA HE BECOME SO SMALL WE OURSELVES SAW MISS LUCY ERE SHE WAS AT PEACE SLIP THROUGH A HAIRBREADTH SPACE AT THE TOMB DOOR HE CAN WHEN ONCE HE FIND HIS WAY
727-124443-0080 COME OUT FROM ANYTHING OR INTO ANYTHING NO MATTER HOW CLOSE IT BE BOUND OR EVEN FUSED UP WITH FIRE SOLDER YOU CALL IT HE CAN SEE IN THE DARK NO SMALL POWER THIS IN A WORLD WHICH IS ONE HALF SHUT FROM THE LIGHT AH
727-124443-0081 HE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS YET HE IS NOT FREE NAY HE IS EVEN MORE PRISONER THAN THE SLAVE OF THE GALLEY THAN THE MADMAN IN HIS CELL HE CANNOT GO WHERE HE LISTS HE WHO IS NOT OF NATURE
727-124443-0082 WHY WE KNOW NOT HE MAY NOT ENTER ANYWHERE AT THE FIRST UNLESS THERE BE SOME ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO BID HIM TO COME THOUGH AFTERWARDS HE CAN COME AS HE PLEASE HIS POWER CEASES AS DOES THAT OF ALL EVIL THINGS AT THE COMING OF THE DAY
727-124443-0083 ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES CAN HE HAVE LIMITED FREEDOM IF HE BE NOT AT THE PLACE WHITHER HE IS BOUND HE CAN ONLY CHANGE HIMSELF AT NOON
727-124443-0084 WE HAVE PROOF BY INFERENCE THUS WHEREAS HE CAN DO AS HE WILL WITHIN HIS LIMIT WHEN HE HAVE HIS EARTH HOME HIS COFFIN HOME HIS HELL HOME THE PLACE UNHALLOWED AS WE SAW WHEN HE WENT TO THE GRAVE OF THE SUICIDE AT WHITBY STILL
727-124443-0085 AT OTHER TIME HE CAN ONLY CHANGE WHEN THE TIME COME IT IS SAID TOO THAT HE CAN ONLY PASS RUNNING WATER AT THE SLACK OR THE FLOOD OF THE TIDE THEN THERE ARE THINGS WHICH SO AFFLICT HIM THAT HE HAS NO POWER AS THE GARLIC THAT WE KNOW OF AND AS FOR THINGS SACRED AS THIS SYMBOL MY CRUCIFIX
727-124443-0086 TO THEM HE IS NOTHING BUT IN THEIR PRESENCE HE TAKE HIS PLACE FAR OFF AND SILENT WITH RESPECT THERE ARE OTHERS TOO WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU OF LEST IN OUR SEEKING WE MAY NEED THEM THE BRANCH OF WILD ROSE ON HIS COFFIN KEEP HIM
727-124443-0087 A SACRED BULLET FIRED INTO THE COFFIN KILL HIM SO THAT HE BE TRUE DEAD AND AS FOR THE STAKE THROUGH HIM WE KNOW ALREADY OF ITS PEACE OR THE CUT OFF HEAD THAT GIVETH REST WE HAVE SEEN IT
727-124443-0088 THUS WHEN WE FIND THE HABITATION OF THIS MAN THAT WAS WE CAN CONFINE HIM TO HIS COFFIN AND DESTROY HIM IF WE OBEY WHAT WE KNOW BUT HE IS CLEVER I HAVE ASKED MY FRIEND ARMINIUS OF BUDA PESTH UNIVERSITY TO MAKE HIS RECORD
727-124443-0089 AND FROM ALL THE MEANS THAT ARE HE TELL ME OF WHAT HE HAS BEEN
727-124443-0090 WHO WON HIS NAME AGAINST THE TURK OVER THE GREAT RIVER ON THE VERY FRONTIER OF TURKEY LAND IF IT BE SO THEN WAS HE NO COMMON MAN FOR IN THAT TIME AND FOR CENTURIES AFTER HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE CLEVEREST AND THE MOST CUNNING
727-124443-0091 AS WELL AS THE BRAVEST OF THE SONS OF THE LAND BEYOND THE FOREST THAT MIGHTY BRAIN AND THAT IRON RESOLUTION WENT WITH HIM TO HIS GRAVE AND ARE EVEN NOW ARRAYED AGAINST US THE DRACULAS WERE SAYS ARMINIUS A GREAT AND NOBLE RACE
727-124443-0092 THOUGH NOW AND AGAIN WERE SCIONS WHO WERE HELD BY THEIR COEVALS TO HAVE HAD DEALINGS WITH THE EVIL ONE
727-124443-0093 AMONGST THE MOUNTAINS OVER LAKE HERMANSTADT WHERE THE DEVIL CLAIMS THE TENTH SCHOLAR AS HIS DUE IN THE RECORDS ARE SUCH WORDS AS
727-124443-0094 WITCH ORDOG AND POKOL' SATAN AND HELL AND IN ONE MANUSCRIPT THIS VERY DRACULA IS SPOKEN OF AS
727-124443-0095 WHICH WE ALL UNDERSTAND TOO WELL THERE HAVE BEEN FROM THE LOINS OF THIS VERY ONE GREAT MEN AND GOOD WOMEN AND THEIR GRAVES MAKE SACRED THE EARTH WHERE ALONE THIS FOULNESS CAN DWELL
727-124443-0096 THAT THIS EVIL THING IS ROOTED DEEP IN ALL GOOD IN SOIL BARREN OF HOLY MEMORIES IT CANNOT REST
727-124443-0097 MISTER MORRIS WAS LOOKING STEADILY AT THE WINDOW AND HE NOW GOT UP QUIETLY AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE AND THEN THE PROFESSOR WENT ON AND NOW WE MUST SETTLE WHAT WE DO WE HAVE HERE MUCH DATA AND WE MUST PROCEED TO LAY OUT OUR CAMPAIGN
727-124443-0098 WE KNOW FROM THE INQUIRY OF JONATHAN THAT FROM THE CASTLE TO WHITBY CAME FIFTY BOXES OF EARTH ALL OF WHICH WERE DELIVERED AT CARFAX WE ALSO KNOW
727-124443-0099 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OUR FIRST STEP SHOULD BE TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER ALL THE REST REMAIN IN THE HOUSE BEYOND THAT WALL WHERE WE LOOK TO DAY OR WHETHER ANY MORE HAVE BEEN REMOVED IF THE LATTER WE MUST TRACE HERE
727-124443-0100 WE WERE INTERRUPTED IN A VERY STARTLING WAY OUTSIDE THE HOUSE CAME THE SOUND OF A PISTOL SHOT THE GLASS OF THE WINDOW WAS SHATTERED WITH A BULLET WHICH RICOCHETTING FROM THE TOP OF THE EMBRASURE STRUCK THE FAR WALL OF THE ROOM I AM AFRAID I AM AT HEART A COWARD FOR I SHRIEKED OUT
727-124443-0101 THE MEN ALL JUMPED TO THEIR FEET LORD GODALMING FLEW OVER TO THE WINDOW AND THREW UP THE SASH AS HE DID SO WE HEARD MISTER MORRIS'S VOICE WITHOUT SORRY
727-124443-0102 A MINUTE LATER HE CAME IN AND SAID IT WAS AN IDIOTIC THING OF ME TO DO AND I ASK YOUR PARDON MISSUS HARKER MOST SINCERELY
727-124443-0103 BUT THE FACT IS THAT WHILST THE PROFESSOR WAS TALKING THERE CAME A BIG BAT AND SAT ON THE WINDOW SILL I HAVE GOT SUCH A HORROR OF THE DAMNED BRUTES FROM RECENT EVENTS THAT I CANNOT STAND THEM AND I WENT OUT TO HAVE A SHOT
727-124443-0104 DID YOU HIT IT ASKED DOCTOR VAN HELSING I DON'T KNOW I FANCY NOT FOR IT FLEW AWAY INTO THE WOOD WITHOUT SAYING ANY MORE HE TOOK HIS SEAT AND THE PROFESSOR
727-124443-0105 STRENGTH BEING THE BEST SAFETY THROUGH CARE OF ME BUT THEIR MINDS WERE MADE UP AND THOUGH IT WAS A BITTER PILL FOR ME TO SWALLOW I COULD SAY NOTHING SAVE TO ACCEPT THEIR CHIVALROUS CARE OF ME MISTER MORRIS RESUMED THE DISCUSSION AS THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE
727-124443-0106 I VOTE WE HAVE A LOOK AT HIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW TIME IS EVERYTHING WITH HIM AND SWIFT ACTION ON OUR PART MAY SAVE ANOTHER VICTIM I OWN THAT MY HEART BEGAN TO FAIL ME WHEN THE TIME FOR ACTION CAME SO CLOSE BUT I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING
727-124443-0107 FOR I HAD A GREATER FEAR THAT IF I APPEARED AS A DRAG OR A HINDRANCE TO THEIR WORK THEY MIGHT EVEN LEAVE ME OUT OF THEIR COUNSELS ALTOGETHER THEY HAVE NOW GONE OFF TO CARFAX WITH MEANS TO GET INTO THE HOUSE MANLIKE THEY HAD TOLD ME TO GO TO BED AND SLEEP
727-124443-0108 AS IF A WOMAN CAN SLEEP WHEN THOSE SHE LOVES ARE IN DANGER I SHALL LIE DOWN AND PRETEND TO SLEEP LEST JONATHAN HAVE ADDED ANXIETY ABOUT ME WHEN HE RETURNS DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY
727-124443-0109 TO KNOW IF I WOULD SEE HIM AT ONCE AS HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO SAY TO ME I TOLD THE MESSENGER TO SAY THAT I WOULD ATTEND TO HIS WISHES IN THE MORNING I WAS BUSY JUST AT THE MOMENT THE ATTENDANT ADDED HE SEEMS VERY IMPORTUNATE SIR I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SO EAGER
727-124443-0110 I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT IF YOU DON'T SEE HIM SOON HE WILL HAVE ONE OF HIS VIOLENT FITS
727-124443-0111 ALL RIGHT I'LL GO NOW AND I ASKED THE OTHERS TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES FOR ME AS I HAD TO GO AND SEE MY PATIENT TAKE ME WITH YOU FRIEND JOHN SAID THE PROFESSOR HIS CASE IN YOUR DIARY INTEREST ME MUCH AND IT HAD BEARING TOO NOW AND AGAIN ON OUR CASE
727-124443-0112 AND ESPECIAL WHEN HIS MIND IS DISTURBED
727-124443-0113 ASKED LORD GODALMING ME TOO SAID QUINCEY MORRIS MAY I COME SAID HARKER I NODDED
727-124443-0114 BUT NONE OF THE OTHERS AT FIRST SAID ANYTHING HIS REQUEST WAS THAT I WOULD AT ONCE RELEASE HIM FROM THE ASYLUM AND SEND HIM HOME THIS HE BACKED UP WITH ARGUMENTS REGARDING HIS COMPLETE RECOVERY
727-124443-0115 I APPEAL TO YOUR FRIENDS HE SAID THEY WILL PERHAPS NOT MIND SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON MY CASE BY THE WAY YOU HAVE NOT INTRODUCED ME I WAS SO MUCH ASTONISHED THAT THE ODDNESS OF INTRODUCING A MADMAN IN AN ASYLUM DID NOT STRIKE ME AT THE MOMENT AND BESIDES
727-124443-0116 THERE WAS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN THE MAN'S MANNER SO MUCH OF THE HABIT OF EQUALITY THAT I AT ONCE MADE THE INTRODUCTION LORD GODALMING PROFESSOR VAN HELSING MISTER QUINCEY MORRIS OF TEXAS
727-124443-0117 HE SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OF THEM SAYING IN TURN LORD GODALMING I HAD THE HONOUR OF SECONDING YOUR FATHER AT THE WINDHAM I GRIEVE TO KNOW BY YOUR HOLDING THE TITLE THAT HE IS NO MORE HE WAS A MAN LOVED AND HONOURED BY ALL WHO KNEW HIM
727-124443-0118 MISTER MORRIS YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOUR GREAT STATE ITS RECEPTION INTO THE UNION WAS A PRECEDENT WHICH MAY HAVE FAR REACHING EFFECTS HEREAFTER WHEN THE POLE AND THE TROPICS MAY HOLD ALLIANCE TO THE STARS AND STRIPES THE POWER OF TREATY MAY YET PROVE A VAST ENGINE OF ENLARGEMENT
727-124443-0119 SIR I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR DROPPING ALL FORMS OF CONVENTIONAL PREFIX WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL HAS REVOLUTIONISED THERAPEUTICS BY HIS DISCOVERY OF THE CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION OF BRAIN MATTER CONVENTIONAL FORMS ARE UNFITTING SINCE THEY WOULD SEEM TO LIMIT HIM TO ONE OF A CLASS
727-124443-0120 YOU GENTLEMEN WHO BY NATIONALITY BY HEREDITY
727-124443-0121 AS AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF MEN WHO ARE IN FULL POSSESSION OF THEIR LIBERTIES
727-124443-0122 HUMANITARIAN AND MEDICO JURIST AS WELL AS SCIENTIST WILL DEEM IT A MORAL DUTY TO DEAL WITH ME AS ONE TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES HE MADE THIS LAST APPEAL WITH A COURTLY AIR OF CONVICTION WHICH WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS OWN CHARM
727-124443-0123 I THINK WE WERE ALL STAGGERED FOR MY OWN PART I WAS UNDER THE CONVICTION DESPITE MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAN'S CHARACTER AND HISTORY THAT HIS REASON HAD BEEN RESTORED
727-124443-0124 AND WOULD SEE ABOUT THE NECESSARY FORMALITIES FOR HIS RELEASE IN THE MORNING I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO WAIT HOWEVER BEFORE MAKING SO GRAVE A STATEMENT FOR OF OLD I KNEW THE SUDDEN CHANGES TO WHICH THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT WAS LIABLE SO I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH MAKING A GENERAL STATEMENT
727-124443-0125 THAT HE APPEARED TO BE IMPROVING VERY RAPIDLY THAT I WOULD HAVE A LONGER CHAT WITH HIM IN THE MORNING
727-124443-0126 THIS DID NOT AT ALL SATISFY HIM FOR HE SAID QUICKLY
727-124443-0127 THAT YOU HARDLY APPREHEND MY WISH I DESIRE TO GO AT ONCE HERE NOW THIS VERY HOUR THIS VERY MOMENT IF I MAY TIME PRESSES
727-124443-0128 I AM SURE IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO PUT BEFORE SO ADMIRABLE A PRACTITIONER
727-124443-0129 YET SO MOMENTOUS A WISH TO ENSURE ITS FULFILMENT HE LOOKED AT ME KEENLY AND SEEING THE NEGATIVE IN MY FACE TURNED TO THE OTHERS AND SCRUTINISED THEM CLOSELY NOT MEETING ANY SUFFICIENT RESPONSE HE WENT ON
727-124443-0130 YOU HAVE I SAID FRANKLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS I FELT BRUTALLY THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE AND THEN HE SAID SLOWLY THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST ONLY SHIFT MY GROUND OF REQUEST LET ME ASK FOR THIS CONCESSION BOON
727-124443-0131 I AM CONTENT TO IMPLORE IN SUCH A CASE NOT ON PERSONAL GROUNDS
