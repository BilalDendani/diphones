1498-140040-0000 SUNSHINE IN A SHADY PLACE
1498-140040-0001 BUT IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT REBECCA HAD HER BOOKS AND HER NEW ACQUAINTANCES TO KEEP HER INTERESTED AND OCCUPIED
1498-140040-0002 SHE TRIED TO LIKE HER AUNT MIRANDA
1498-140040-0003 BUT FAILED IGNOMINIOUSLY IN THE ATTEMPT SHE WAS A VERY FAULTY AND PASSIONATELY HUMAN CHILD WITH NO ASPIRATIONS TOWARDS BEING AN ANGEL OF THE HOUSE BUT SHE HAD A SENSE OF DUTY AND A DESIRE TO BE GOOD RESPECTABLY DECENTLY GOOD
1498-140040-0004 WHENEVER SHE FELL BELOW THIS SELF IMPOSED STANDARD SHE WAS MISERABLE SHE DID NOT LIKE TO BE UNDER HER AUNT'S ROOF EATING BREAD WEARING CLOTHES AND STUDYING BOOKS PROVIDED BY HER AND DISLIKE HER SO HEARTILY ALL THE TIME SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT THIS WAS WRONG AND MEAN
1498-140040-0005 AND WHENEVER THE FEELING OF REMORSE WAS STRONG WITHIN HER SHE MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT TO PLEASE HER GRIM AND DIFFICULT RELATIVE BUT HOW COULD SHE SUCCEED WHEN SHE WAS NEVER HERSELF IN HER AUNT MIRANDA'S PRESENCE THE SEARCHING LOOK OF THE EYES THE SHARP VOICE THE HARD KNOTTY FINGERS
1498-140040-0006 THE THIN STRAIGHT LIPS THE LONG SILENCES THE FRONT PIECE THAT DIDN'T MATCH HER HAIR THE VERY OBVIOUS PARTING THAT SEEMED SEWED IN WITH LINEN THREAD ON BLACK NET THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE ITEM THAT APPEALED TO REBECCA
1498-140040-0007 THERE ARE CERTAIN NARROW UNIMAGINATIVE AND AUTOCRATIC OLD PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO CALL OUT THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS AND SOMETIMES THE WORST TRAITS IN CHILDREN MISS MIRANDA HAD SHE LIVED IN A POPULOUS NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD HAVE HAD HER DOORBELL PULLED HER GATE TIED UP
1498-140040-0008 OR DIRT TRAPS SET IN HER GARDEN PATHS THE SIMPSON TWINS STOOD IN SUCH AWE OF HER THAT THEY COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO COME TO THE SIDE DOOR EVEN WHEN MISS JANE HELD GINGERBREAD COOKIES IN HER OUTSTRETCHED HANDS IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT REBECCA IRRITATED HER AUNT WITH EVERY BREATH SHE DREW
1498-140040-0009 SHE LEFT THE DIPPER ON THE KITCHEN SHELF INSTEAD OF HANGING IT UP OVER THE PAIL
1498-140040-0010 SHE WAS WILLING TO GO ON ERRANDS BUT OFTEN FORGOT WHAT SHE WAS SENT FOR SHE LEFT THE SCREEN DOORS AJAR SO THAT FLIES CAME IN HER TONGUE WAS EVER IN MOTION SHE SANG OR WHISTLED WHEN SHE WAS PICKING UP CHIPS
1498-140040-0011 SHE WAS ALWAYS MESSING WITH FLOWERS PUTTING THEM IN VASES PINNING THEM ON HER DRESS AND STICKING THEM IN HER HAT FINALLY SHE WAS AN EVERLASTING REMINDER OF HER FOOLISH WORTHLESS FATHER WHOSE HANDSOME FACE AND ENGAGING MANNER HAD SO DECEIVED AURELIA
1498-140040-0012 AND PERHAPS IF THE FACTS WERE KNOWN OTHERS BESIDES AURELIA THE RANDALLS WERE ALIENS
1498-140040-0013 MIRANDA WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ON COMPULSION THAT IN THE NATURE OF THINGS A LARGE NUMBER OF PERSONS MUST NECESSARILY BE BORN OUTSIDE THIS SACRED PRECINCT BUT SHE HAD HER OPINION OF THEM AND IT WAS NOT A FLATTERING ONE NOW IF HANNAH HAD COME
1498-140040-0014 HANNAH TOOK AFTER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE SHE WAS ALL SAWYER POOR HANNAH THAT WAS TRUE HANNAH SPOKE ONLY WHEN SPOKEN TO INSTEAD OF FIRST LAST AND ALL THE TIME HANNAH AT FOURTEEN WAS A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH HANNAH LIKED TO KNIT
1498-140040-0015 HANNAH WAS PROBABLY OR WOULD HAVE BEEN A PATTERN OF ALL THE SMALLER VIRTUES INSTEAD OF WHICH HERE WAS THIS BLACK HAIRED GYPSY
1498-140040-0016 WHAT SUNSHINE IN A SHADY PLACE WAS AUNT JANE TO REBECCA AUNT JANE WITH HER QUIET VOICE HER UNDERSTANDING EYES HER READY EXCUSES IN THESE FIRST DIFFICULT WEEKS WHEN THE IMPULSIVE LITTLE STRANGER WAS TRYING TO SETTLE DOWN INTO THE BRICK HOUSE WAYS SHE DID LEARN THEM
1498-140040-0017 IN PART AND BY DEGREES AND THE CONSTANT FITTING OF HERSELF TO THESE NEW AND DIFFICULT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT SEEMED TO MAKE HER OLDER THAN EVER FOR HER YEARS THE CHILD TOOK HER SEWING AND SAT BESIDE AUNT JANE IN THE KITCHEN
1498-140040-0018 WHILE AUNT MIRANDA HAD THE POST OF OBSERVATION AT THE SITTING ROOM WINDOW SOMETIMES THEY WOULD WORK ON THE SIDE PORCH
1498-140040-0019 TO REBECCA THE LENGTHS OF BROWN GINGHAM WERE INTERMINABLE SHE MADE HARD WORK OF SEWING BROKE THE THREAD
1498-140040-0020 PRICKED HER FINGER WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HER FOREHEAD COULD NOT MATCH THE CHECKS PUCKERED THE SEAMS SHE POLISHED HER NEEDLES TO NOTHING PUSHING THEM IN AND OUT OF THE EMERY STRAWBERRY BUT THEY ALWAYS SQUEAKED
1498-140040-0021 STILL AUNT JANE'S PATIENCE HELD GOOD AND SOME SMALL MEASURE OF SKILL WAS CREEPING INTO REBECCA'S FINGERS FINGERS THAT HELD PENCIL PAINT BRUSH AND PEN SO CLEVERLY AND WERE SO CLUMSY WITH THE DAINTY LITTLE NEEDLE
1498-140040-0022 WHEN THE FIRST BROWN GINGHAM FROCK WAS COMPLETED THE CHILD SEIZED WHAT SHE THOUGHT AN OPPORTUNE MOMENT AND ASKED HER AUNT MIRANDA IF SHE MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER COLOR FOR THE NEXT ONE I BOUGHT A WHOLE PIECE OF THE BROWN SAID MIRANDA LACONICALLY THAT'LL GIVE YOU TWO MORE DRESSES WITH PLENTY FOR NEW SLEEVES
1498-140040-0023 I KNOW BUT MISTER WATSON SAYS HE'LL TAKE BACK PART OF IT AND LET US HAVE PINK AND BLUE FOR THE SAME PRICE DID YOU ASK HIM YES'M
1498-140040-0024 PINK KEEPS CLEAN JUST AS NICE AS BROWN AND MISTER WATSON SAYS IT'LL BOIL WITHOUT FADING
1498-140040-0025 I DON'T APPROVE OF CHILDREN BEING RIGGED OUT IN FANCY COLORS BUT I'LL SEE WHAT YOUR AUNT JANE THINKS I THINK IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT TO LET REBECCA HAVE ONE PINK AND ONE BLUE GINGHAM SAID JANE A CHILD GETS TIRED OF SEWING ON ONE COLOR
1498-140040-0026 IT'S ONLY NATURAL SHE SHOULD LONG FOR A CHANGE
1498-140040-0027 AND IT'S DREADFUL UNBECOMING TO HER HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES SAY I
1498-140040-0028 AND THERE'S NO USE IN HUMORING HER TO THINK ABOUT HER LOOKS I BELIEVE SHE'S VAIN AS A PEACOCK NOW WITHOUT ANYTHING TO BE VAIN OF
1498-140040-0029 I REMEMBER WELL ENOUGH HOW I FELT AT HER AGE YOU WAS CONSIDERABLE OF A FOOL AT HER AGE JANE YES I WAS THANK THE LORD
1498-140040-0030 TO BRIGHTEN MY DECLINING YEARS THERE FINALLY WAS A PINK GINGHAM AND WHEN IT WAS NICELY FINISHED AUNT JANE GAVE REBECCA A DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE SHE SHOWED HER HOW TO MAKE A PRETTY TRIMMING OF NARROW WHITE LINEN TAPE
1498-140040-0031 IT'LL BE GOOD FANCY WORK FOR YOU REBECCA FOR YOUR AUNT MIRANDA WON'T LIKE TO SEE YOU ALWAYS READING IN THE LONG WINTER EVENINGS NOW IF YOU THINK YOU CAN BASTE TWO ROWS OF WHITE TAPE ROUND THE BOTTOM OF YOUR PINK SKIRT AND KEEP IT STRAIGHT BY THE CHECKS
1498-140040-0032 I'LL STITCH THEM ON FOR YOU AND TRIM THE WAIST AND SLEEVES WITH POINTED TAPE TRIMMING SO THE DRESS'LL BE REAL PRETTY FOR SECOND BEST REBECCA'S JOY KNEW NO BOUNDS I'LL BASTE LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE SHE EXCLAIMED IT'S A THOUSAND YARDS ROUND THAT SKIRT AS WELL I KNOW HAVING HEMMED IT
1498-140040-0033 OH DO YOU THINK AUNT MIRANDY'LL EVER LET ME GO TO MILLTOWN WITH MISTER COBB HE'S ASKED ME AGAIN YOU KNOW
1498-140040-0034 I SEE SUSAN SIMPSON AND THE TWINS AND EMMA JANE PERKINS HIDING BEHIND THE FENCE REBECCA LEAPED OFF THE PORCH SNATCHED ALICE ROBINSON FROM UNDER THE CURRANT BUSHES
1498-140040-0035 IN GETTING EMMA JANE AWAY FROM THE SIMPSON PARTY AND GIVING THEM THE SLIP ALTOGETHER THEY WERE MUCH TOO SMALL FOR CERTAIN PLEASURABLE ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR THAT AFTERNOON BUT THEY WERE NOT TO BE DESPISED FOR THEY HAD THE MOST FASCINATING DOORYARD IN THE VILLAGE
1498-140040-0036 IN IT IN BEWILDERING CONFUSION WERE OLD SLEIGHS PUNGS HORSE RAKES HOGSHEADS SETTEES WITHOUT BACKS BED STEADS WITHOUT HEADS IN ALL STAGES OF DISABILITY AND NEVER THE SAME ON TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS
1498-140040-0037 MISSUS SIMPSON WAS SELDOM AT HOME AND EVEN WHEN SHE WAS HAD LITTLE CONCERN AS TO WHAT HAPPENED ON THE PREMISES A FAVORITE DIVERSION WAS TO MAKE THE HOUSE INTO A FORT
1498-140040-0038 GREAT CARE WAS USED IN APPORTIONING THE PARTS FOR THERE WAS NO DISPOSITION TO LET ANYBODY WIN BUT THE AMERICANS SEESAW SIMPSON WAS USUALLY MADE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE BRITISH ARMY AND A LIMP AND UNCERTAIN ONE HE WAS
1498-140040-0039 CAPABLE WITH HIS CONTRADICTORY ORDERS AND HIS FONDNESS FOR THE EXTREME REAR OF LEADING ANY REGIMENT TO AN INGLORIOUS DEATH SOMETIMES THE LONG SUFFERING HOUSE WAS A LOG HUT AND THE BRAVE SETTLERS DEFEATED A BAND OF HOSTILE INDIANS
1498-140040-0040 OR OCCASIONALLY WERE MASSACRED BY THEM BUT IN EITHER CASE THE SIMPSON HOUSE LOOKED TO QUOTE A RIVERBORO EXPRESSION AS IF THE DEVIL HAD BEEN HAVING AN AUCTION IN IT NEXT TO THIS UNCOMMONLY INTERESTING PLAYGROUND AS A FIELD OF ACTION CAME IN THE CHILDREN'S OPINION THE SECRET SPOT
1498-140040-0041 AS WELL AS VERDANT LEVELS ON WHICH TO BUILD HOUSES A GROUP OF TREES CONCEALED IT SOMEWHAT FROM VIEW AND FLUNG A GRATEFUL SHADE OVER THE DWELLINGS ERECTED THERE
1498-140040-0042 HERE IN SOAP BOXES HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES WERE STORED ALL THEIR TREASURES WEE BASKETS AND PLATES AND CUPS MADE OF BURDOCK BALLS BITS OF BROKEN CHINA FOR PARTIES
1498-140040-0043 DEATHS FUNERALS WEDDINGS CHRISTENINGS A TALL SQUARE HOUSE OF STICKINS WAS TO BE BUILT ROUND REBECCA THIS AFTERNOON AND SHE WAS TO BE CHARLOTTE CORDAY LEANING AGAINST THE BARS OF HER PRISON
1498-140040-0044 IT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE STANDING INSIDE THE BUILDING WITH EMMA JANE'S APRON WOUND ABOUT HER HAIR
1498-140040-0045 THAT HER EYES WERE NO LONGER REBECCA RANDALL'S BUT MIRRORED SOMETHING OF CHARLOTTE CORDAY'S HAPLESS WOE
1498-140040-0046 IT'S BEEN SUCH A SIGHT OF WORK IF YOU THINK YOU COULD MOVE UP SOME STONES
1498-140040-0047 SUGGESTED CHARLOTTE CORDAY THEN LEAVE THE STONES AND YOU TWO CAN STEP DOWN INTO THE PRISON TO MORROW AND BE THE TWO LITTLE PRINCES IN THE TOWER AND I CAN MURDER YOU WHAT PRINCES WHAT TOWER ASKED ALICE AND EMMA JANE IN ONE BREATH TELL US ABOUT THEM
1498-140040-0048 NOT NOW IT'S MY SUPPER TIME REBECCA WAS A SOMEWHAT FIRM DISCIPLINARIAN
1498-140040-0049 THOUGH YOU ARE AWFUL REAL WHEN YOU MURDER OR WE COULD HAVE ELIJAH AND ELISHA FOR THE PRINCES THEY'D YELL WHEN THEY WAS MURDERED OBJECTED ALICE YOU KNOW HOW SILLY THEY ARE AT PLAYS ALL EXCEPT CLARA BELLE
1498-140040-0050 BESIDES IF WE ONCE SHOW THEM THIS SECRET PLACE THEY'LL PLAY IN IT ALL THE TIME AND PERHAPS THEY'D STEAL THINGS LIKE THEIR FATHER THEY NEEDN'T STEAL JUST BECAUSE THEIR FATHER DOES ARGUED REBECCA AND DON'T YOU EVER TALK ABOUT IT BEFORE THEM IF YOU WANT TO BE MY SECRET PARTIC'LAR FRIENDS
1498-140040-0051 MY MOTHER TELLS ME NEVER TO SAY HARD THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE'S OWN FOLKS TO THEIR FACE SHE SAYS NOBODY CAN BEAR IT AND IT'S WICKED TO SHAME THEM FOR WHAT ISN'T THEIR FAULT
