7437-96153-0000 AND DOG PROVISIONS FOR FORTY BEING NOW ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILES FROM THE POLE WE HOPED TO REACH IT IN FORTY THREE DAYS THEN TURNING SOUTH AND FEEDING LIVING DOGS WITH DEAD MAKE EITHER FRANZ JOSEF LAND OR SPITZBERGEN
7437-96153-0001 AT WHICH LATTER PLACE WE SHOULD VERY LIKELY COME UP WITH A WHALER WELL DURING THE FIRST DAYS PROGRESS WAS VERY SLOW THE ICE BEING ROUGH AND LANEY AND THE DOGS BEHAVING MOST BADLY STOPPING DEAD AT EVERY DIFFICULTY AND LEAPING OVER THE TRACES
7437-96153-0002 AND LAST CAME I WITH A MIXED FREIGHT BUT ON THE THIRD DAY CLARK HAD AN ATTACK OF SNOW BLINDNESS AND MEW TOOK HIS PLACE PRETTY SOON OUR SUFFERINGS COMMENCED AND THEY WERE BITTER ENOUGH THE SUN THOUGH CONSTANTLY VISIBLE DAY AND NIGHT GAVE NO HEAT
7437-96153-0003 OUR SLEEPING BAGS CLARK AND MEW SLEPT TOGETHER IN ONE I IN ANOTHER WERE SOAKING WET ALL THE NIGHT BEING THAWED BY OUR WARMTH AND OUR FINGERS UNDER WRAPPINGS OF SENNE GRASS AND WOLF SKIN WERE ALWAYS BLEEDING
7437-96153-0004 SOMETIMES OUR FRAIL BAMBOO CANE KAYAKS LYING ACROSS THE SLEDGES WOULD CRASH PERILOUSLY AGAINST AN ICE RIDGE AND THEY WERE OUR ONE HOPE OF REACHING LAND BUT THE DOGS WERE THE GREAT DIFFICULTY
7437-96153-0005 WE LOST SIX MORTAL HOURS A DAY IN HARNESSING AND TENDING THEM ON THE TWELFTH DAY
7437-96153-0006 OUR ONE SECRET THOUGHT NOW WAS FOOD FOOD OUR DAY LONG LUST FOR THE EATING TIME MEW SUFFERED FROM ARCTIC THIRST UNDER THESE CONDITIONS MAN BECOMES IN A FEW DAYS NOT A SAVAGE ONLY
7437-96153-0007 HIS DISAPPEARANCE HAD BEEN EXPLAINED BY A HUNDRED DIFFERENT GUESSES ON THE SHIP ALL PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH I HAD NO IDEA THAT ANYONE CONNECTED ME IN ANY WAY WITH HIS DEATH
7437-96153-0008 OUR FRAMES READY TO DROP AND OUR MOOD RAVENOUS AND INFLAMED ONE OF MEW'S DOGS WAS SICK IT WAS NECESSARY TO KILL IT HE ASKED ME TO DO IT OH SAID I YOU KILL YOUR OWN DOG OF COURSE WELL I DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED CATCHING FIRE AT ONCE
7437-96153-0009 YOU OUGHT TO BE USED TO KILLING JEFFSON HOW DO YOU MEAN MEW SAID I WITH A MAD START FOR MADNESS AND THE FLAMES OF HELL WERE INSTANT AND UPPERMOST IN US ALL YOU MEAN BECAUSE MY PROFESSION PROFESSION DAMN IT NO HE SNARLED LIKE A DOG
7437-96153-0010 GO AND DIG UP DAVID WILSON I DARE SAY YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM AND HE WILL TELL YOU MY MEANING RIGHT ENOUGH I RUSHED AT ONCE TO CLARK WHO WAS STOOPING AMONG THE DOGS UNHARNESSING AND SAVAGELY PUSHING HIS SHOULDER I EXCLAIMED
7437-96153-0011 THAT BEAST ACCUSES ME OF MURDERING DAVID WILSON WELL SAID CLARK I'D SPLIT HIS SKULL AS CLEAN GO AWAY ADAM JEFFSON AND LET ME BE SNARLED CLARK IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT TO SAY ABOUT IT THEN YOU
7437-96153-0012 HOWEVER FROM THAT MOMENT A DEEPER MOOD OF BROODING MALICE OCCUPIED MY SPIRIT INDEED THE HUMOUR OF US ALL WAS ONE OF DANGEROUS EVEN MURDEROUS FIERCENESS IN THAT PURSUIT OF RICHES
7437-96153-0013 AND THOUGH SICK TO DEATH BOTH IN SPIRIT AND BODY
7437-96153-0014 BEYOND DOUBT CURSED NOT MEANT TO BE PENETRATED BY MAN AND RAPID AND AWFUL WAS THE DEGENERATION OF OUR SOULS AS FOR ME
7437-96153-0015 SAVAGERY SO HEINOUS COULD BROOD IN A HUMAN BOSOM AS NOW I FELT IT BROOD IN MINE IF MEN COULD ENTER INTO A COUNTRY SPECIALLY SET APART FOR THE HABITATION OF DEVILS AND THERE BECOME POSSESSED OF EVIL
7437-96153-0016 IT WAS NOW THAT WE BEGAN TO ENCOUNTER A SUCCESSION OF STRANGE LOOKING OBJECTS LYING SCATTERED OVER THE ICE WHOSE NUMBER CONTINUALLY INCREASED AS WE PROCEEDED THEY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF ROCKS OR PIECES OF IRON
7437-96153-0017 AND THEY WERE OF EVERY SIZE THEIR INCRUSTATIONS WE SOON DETERMINED TO BE DIAMONDS AND OTHER PRECIOUS STONES ON OUR FIRST TWENTY MILE DAY MEW PICKED UP A DIAMOND CRYSTAL AS LARGE AS A CHILD'S FOOT
7437-96153-0018 WE THUS FOUND THE RICHES WHICH WE SOUGHT BEYOND ALL DREAM BUT AS THE BEAR AND THE WALRUS FIND THEM FOR OURSELVES WE HAD LOST
7437-96153-0019 MEAL CLARK GRUMBLED SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR BEING METEOR STONES WHOSE FERRUGINOUS SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN LURED BY THE MAGNETIC POLE AND KEPT FROM FRICTIONAL BURNING IN THEIR FALL BY THE FRIGIDITY OF THE AIR
7437-96153-0020 AND THEY QUICKLY CEASED TO INTEREST OUR SLUGGISH MINDS EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY OBSTRUCTED OUR WAY WE HAD ALL ALONG HAD GOOD WEATHER
7437-96153-0021 THAT THE HEART QUAILED BENEATH IT IT LASTED IN ITS FULL POWER ONLY AN HOUR BUT DURING THAT TIME SNATCHED TWO OF OUR SLEDGES LONG DISTANCES AND COMPELLED US TO LIE FACE DOWNWARD WE HAD TRAVELLED ALL THE SUN LIT NIGHT
7437-96153-0022 SO AS SOON AS THE WIND ALLOWED US TO HUDDLE TOGETHER OUR SCATTERED THINGS WE CRAWLED INTO THE SLEEPING BAGS AND INSTANTLY SLEPT WE KNEW THAT THE ICE WAS IN AWFUL UPHEAVAL AROUND US WE HEARD AS OUR EYELIDS SWEETLY CLOSED THE SLOW BOOMING OF DISTANT GUNS
7437-96153-0023 IN MY SLEEP IT WAS AS THOUGH SOMEONE SUDDENLY SHOOK MY SHOULDER WITH URGENT UP UP IT WAS NEITHER CLARK NOR MEW BUT A DREAM MERELY FOR CLARK AND MEW WHEN I STARTED UP I SAW LYING STILL IN THEIR SLEEPING BAG
7437-96153-0024 I SUPPOSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT NOON I SAT STARING A MINUTE AND MY FIRST NUMB THOUGHT WAS SOMEHOW THIS THAT THE COUNTESS CLODAGH HAD PRAYED ME BE FIRST' FOR HER
7437-96153-0025 PRECIOUS LITTLE FOR THE FORTUNE WHICH SHE COVETED MILLIONS ON MILLIONS OF FORTUNES LAY UNREGARDED AROUND ME BUT THAT THOUGHT BE FIRST WAS DEEPLY SUGGESTED IN MY BRAIN AS IF WHISPERED THERE INSTINCTIVELY BRUTISHLY
7437-96153-0026 AS THE GADAREAN SWINE RUSHED DOWN A STEEP PLACE I RUBBING MY DAFT EYES AROSE THE FIRST THING WHICH MY MIND OPENED TO PERCEIVE WAS THAT WHILE THE TEMPEST WAS LESS STRONG THE ICE WAS NOW IN EXTRAORDINARY AGITATION
7437-96153-0027 WITHDRAWING IN RAVINES LIKE MUTUAL BACKING CURTSIES THEN SURGING TO CLAP TOGETHER IN PASSIONATE MOUNTAIN PEAKS ELSE JOSTLING LIKE THE SYMPLEGADES FLUENT AND INCONSTANT AS BILLOWS OF THE SEA GRINDING ITSELF
7437-96153-0028 PILING ITSELF POURING ITSELF IN CATARACTS OF POWDERED ICE WHILE HERE AND THERE I SAW THE METEOR STONES LEAP SPASMODICALLY IN DUSTS AND HEAPS LIKE GEYSERS OR SPURTING FROTHS IN A STEAMER'S WAKE
7437-96153-0029 A TREMENDOUS UPROAR MEANTIME FILLING ALL THE AIR AS I STOOD I PLUNGED AND STAGGERED AND I FOUND THE DOGS SPRAWLING WITH WHIMPERINGS ON THE HEAVING FLOOR
7437-96153-0030 INSTINCTIVELY DAFTLY BRUTISHLY
7437-96153-0031 SENT THIN SNOW SWEEPINGS FLYING NORTHWARD PAST ME THE ODOMETER WHICH I HAD WITH ME HAD NOT YET MEASURED FOUR MILES WHEN I BEGAN TO NOTICE TWO THINGS FIRST THAT THE JEWELLED METEOR STONES WERE NOW ACCUMULATING BEYOND ALL LIMIT
7437-96153-0032 FILLING MY RANGE OF VISION TO THE NORTHERN HORIZON WITH A DAZZLING GLISTER IN MOUNDS AND PARTERRES AND SCATTERED DISCONNECTION THEY LAY LIKE LARGESSE OF AUTUMN LEAVES SPREAD OUT OVER THOSE ELYSIAN FIELDS AND FAIRY UPLANDS OF WEALTH TRILLIONS OF BILLIONS
7437-96153-0033 SO THAT I HAD NEED TO STEER MY TWINING WAY AMONG THEM NOW TOO I NOTICED THAT BUT FOR THESE STONES ALL ROUGHNESS HAD DISAPPEARED NOT A TRACE OF THE UPHEAVAL GOING ON A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTH BEING HERE
7437-96153-0034 I SPED I SPUN WITH GRINNING TEETH THAT CHATTERED AND GIBBERED AND EYEBALLS OF DISTRACTION FOR A FEAR TOO MOST COLD AND DREADFUL
