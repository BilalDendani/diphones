176-123270-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN VERTICAL DESCENT NOW BEGAN OUR REAL JOURNEY HITHERTO OUR TOIL HAD OVERCOME ALL DIFFICULTIES NOW DIFFICULTIES WOULD SPRING UP AT EVERY STEP
176-123270-0001 THE SUPREME HOUR HAD COME I MIGHT NOW EITHER SHARE IN THE ENTERPRISE OR REFUSE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I WAS ASHAMED TO RECOIL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HUNTER HANS ACCEPTED THE ENTERPRISE WITH SUCH CALMNESS SUCH INDIFFERENCE
176-123270-0002 SUCH PERFECT DISREGARD OF ANY POSSIBLE DANGER THAT I BLUSHED AT THE IDEA OF BEING LESS BRAVE THAN HE
176-123270-0003 BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GUIDE I HELD MY PEACE MY HEART FLEW BACK TO MY SWEET VIRLANDAISE AND I APPROACHED THE CENTRAL CHIMNEY I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS A HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER AND THREE HUNDRED FEET ROUND
176-123270-0004 MY HAIR STOOD ON END WITH TERROR THE BEWILDERING FEELING OF VACUITY LAID HOLD UPON ME I FELT MY CENTRE OF GRAVITY SHIFTING ITS PLACE AND GIDDINESS MOUNTING INTO MY BRAIN LIKE DRUNKENNESS
176-123270-0005 I WAS JUST ABOUT TO DROP DOWN WHEN A HAND LAID HOLD OF ME IT WAS THAT OF HANS
176-123270-0006 A ROPE FASTENED TO THE EDGE OF THE APERTURE MIGHT HAVE HELPED US DOWN BUT HOW WERE WE TO UNFASTEN IT WHEN ARRIVED AT THE OTHER END MY UNCLE EMPLOYED A VERY SIMPLE EXPEDIENT TO OBVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY HE UNCOILED A CORD OF THE THICKNESS OF A FINGER
176-123270-0007 AND FOUR HUNDRED FEET LONG FIRST HE DROPPED HALF OF IT DOWN THEN HE PASSED IT ROUND A LAVA BLOCK THAT PROJECTED CONVENIENTLY AND THREW THE OTHER HALF DOWN THE CHIMNEY EACH OF US COULD THEN DESCEND BY HOLDING WITH THE HAND BOTH HALVES OF THE ROPE
176-123270-0008 EACH OF US WILL STRAP ONE UPON HIS BACK I MEAN ONLY FRAGILE ARTICLES OF COURSE WE WERE NOT INCLUDED UNDER THAT HEAD HANS SAID HE
176-123270-0009 BUT SAID I THE CLOTHES AND THAT MASS OF LADDERS AND ROPES WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THEM
176-123270-0010 HOW SO I ASKED YOU WILL SEE PRESENTLY MY UNCLE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO EMPLOY MAGNIFICENT RESOURCES OBEYING ORDERS HANS TIED ALL THE NON FRAGILE ARTICLES IN ONE BUNDLE CORDED THEM FIRMLY
176-123270-0011 AND SENT THEM BODILY DOWN THE GULF BEFORE US I LISTENED TO THE DULL THUDS OF THE DESCENDING BALE MY UNCLE LEANING OVER THE ABYSS FOLLOWED THE DESCENT OF THE LUGGAGE WITH A SATISFIED NOD AND ONLY ROSE ERECT WHEN HE HAD QUITE LOST SIGHT OF IT
176-123270-0012 NOW IT IS OUR TURN NOW I ASK ANY SENSIBLE MAN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HEAR THOSE WORDS WITHOUT A SHUDDER THE PROFESSOR FASTENED HIS PACKAGE OF INSTRUMENTS UPON HIS SHOULDERS HANS TOOK THE TOOLS I TOOK THE ARMS
176-123270-0013 AND THE DESCENT COMMENCED IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER HANS MY UNCLE AND MYSELF IT WAS EFFECTED IN PROFOUND SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE DESCENT OF LOOSENED STONES DOWN THE DARK GULF
176-123270-0014 I DROPPED AS IT WERE FRANTICALLY CLUTCHING THE DOUBLE CORD WITH ONE HAND AND BUTTRESSING MYSELF FROM THE WALL WITH THE OTHER BY MEANS OF MY STICK ONE IDEA OVERPOWERED ME ALMOST FEAR LEST THE ROCK SHOULD GIVE WAY FROM WHICH I WAS HANGING
176-123270-0015 THIS CORD SEEMED A FRAGILE THING FOR THREE PERSONS TO BE SUSPENDED FROM I MADE AS LITTLE USE OF IT AS POSSIBLE PERFORMING WONDERFUL FEATS OF EQUILIBRIUM UPON THE LAVA PROJECTIONS WHICH MY FOOT SEEMED TO CATCH HOLD OF LIKE A HAND
176-123270-0016 WHEN ONE OF THESE SLIPPERY STEPS SHOOK UNDER THE HEAVIER FORM OF HANS HE SAID IN HIS TRANQUIL VOICE
176-123270-0017 IN HALF AN HOUR WE WERE STANDING UPON THE SURFACE OF A ROCK JAMMED IN ACROSS THE CHIMNEY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER HANS PULLED THE ROPE BY ONE OF ITS ENDS THE OTHER ROSE IN THE AIR
176-123270-0018 LEANING OVER THE EDGE OF OUR NARROW STANDING GROUND I OBSERVED THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE WAS STILL INVISIBLE THE SAME MANOEUVRE WAS REPEATED WITH THE CORD AND HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE HAD DESCENDED ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FEET
176-123270-0019 I DON'T SUPPOSE THE MADDEST GEOLOGIST UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE STUDIED THE NATURE OF THE ROCKS THAT WE WERE PASSING I AM SURE I DID TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT THEM
176-123270-0020 CARBONIFEROUS DEVONIAN SILURIAN OR PRIMITIVE WAS ALL ONE TO ME BUT THE PROFESSOR NO DOUBT WAS PURSUING HIS OBSERVATIONS OR TAKING NOTES FOR IN ONE OF OUR HALTS HE SAID TO ME THE FARTHER I GO THE MORE CONFIDENCE I FEEL
176-123270-0021 THE ORDER OF THESE VOLCANIC FORMATIONS AFFORDS THE STRONGEST CONFIRMATION TO THE THEORIES OF DAVY
176-123270-0022 I REPUDIATE THE NOTION OF CENTRAL HEAT ALTOGETHER
176-123270-0023 NO VARIATION ALWAYS THE SAME CONCLUSION
176-123270-0024 MY SILENCE WAS TAKEN FOR CONSENT AND THE DESCENT WENT ON ANOTHER THREE HOURS AND I SAW NO BOTTOM TO THE CHIMNEY YET WHEN I LIFTED MY HEAD I PERCEIVED THE GRADUAL CONTRACTION OF ITS APERTURE ITS WALLS BY A GENTLE INCLINE WERE DRAWING CLOSER TO EACH OTHER
176-123270-0025 AND IT WAS BEGINNING TO GROW DARKER STILL WE KEPT DESCENDING IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE FALLING STONES WERE MEETING WITH AN EARLIER RESISTANCE AND THAT THE CONCUSSION GAVE A MORE ABRUPT AND DEADENED SOUND
176-123270-0026 WHICH I KNEW THAT WE HAD REPEATED FOURTEEN TIMES EACH DESCENT OCCUPYING HALF AN HOUR THE CONCLUSION WAS EASY THAT WE HAD BEEN SEVEN HOURS PLUS FOURTEEN QUARTERS OF REST MAKING TEN HOURS AND A HALF WE HAD STARTED AT ONE IT MUST THEREFORE NOW BE ELEVEN O'CLOCK
176-123270-0027 I STOPPED SHORT JUST AS I WAS GOING TO PLACE MY FEET UPON MY UNCLE'S HEAD
176-123270-0028 WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT TO MORROW LET US HAVE OUR SUPPER AND GO TO SLEEP THE DARKNESS WAS NOT YET COMPLETE THE PROVISION CASE WAS OPENED WE REFRESHED OURSELVES AND WENT TO SLEEP AS WELL AS WE COULD UPON A BED OF STONES AND LAVA FRAGMENTS
176-123270-0029 WHEN LYING ON MY BACK I OPENED MY EYES AND SAW A BRIGHT SPARKLING POINT OF LIGHT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE GIGANTIC TUBE THREE THOUSAND FEET LONG NOW A VAST TELESCOPE IT WAS A STAR WHICH SEEN FROM THIS DEPTH
176-123270-0030 HAD LOST ALL SCINTILLATION AND WHICH BY MY COMPUTATION SHOULD BE FORTY SIX URSA MINOR
