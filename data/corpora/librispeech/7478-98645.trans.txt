7478-98645-0000 THOUGH PROFESSIONAL TAILORS ARE MOSTLY MEN
7478-98645-0001 AND AS INSTRUCTORS IN THE CEREMONIAL TEA ETIQUETTE MUSIC PAINTING AND FLOWER ARRANGEMENT MANY WOMEN OF THE OLD SCHOOL ARE ABLE TO EARN AN INDEPENDENCE THOUGH NONE OF THESE OCCUPATIONS ARE CONFINED TO THE WOMEN ALONE THE BUSINESS OF HOTEL KEEPING WE HAVE REFERRED TO IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER
7478-98645-0002 AND IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT UNLESS A HOTEL KEEPER HAS A CAPABLE WIFE HIS BUSINESS WILL NOT SUCCEED AT PRESENT
7478-98645-0003 SMALL RESTAURANTS WHERE FOOD IS SERVED IN THE FOREIGN STYLE ARE SPRINGING UP AND THESE ARE USUALLY CONDUCTED BY A MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO HAVE AT SOME TIME SERVED AS COOK AND WAITRESS IN A FOREIGN FAMILY AND WHO CONDUCT THE BUSINESS COOPERATIVELY AND ON TERMS OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP AND EQUALITY
7478-98645-0004 IN THESE LITTLE EATING HOUSES WHERE A WELL COOKED FOREIGN DINNER OF FROM THREE TO SIX COURSES IS SERVED FOR THE MODERATE SUM OF THIRTY OR FORTY CENTS THE MAN USUALLY DOES THE COOKING THE WOMAN THE SERVING AND HANDLING OF THE MONEY
7478-98645-0005 UNTIL THE TIME ARRIVES WHEN THE PROFITS OF THE BUSINESS ARE SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY THE HIRING OF MORE HELP WHEN THIS TIME COMES THE LABOR IS REDISTRIBUTED THE WOMAN FREQUENTLY TAKING UPON HERSELF THE RECEPTION OF THE GUESTS AND THE KEEPING OF THE ACCOUNTS
7478-98645-0006 ONE IMPORTANT CALLING IN THE EYES OF MANY PERSONS ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE LOWER CLASSES IS THAT OF FORTUNE TELLING AND THESE GUIDES IN ALL MATTERS OF LIFE BOTH GREAT AND SMALL ARE TO BE FOUND IN EVERY SECTION OF THE CITY
7478-98645-0007 AN IMPENDING MARRIAGE AN ILLNESS
7478-98645-0008 A JOURNEY ABOUT TO BE TAKEN THESE ARE ALL SUBJECTS FOR THE FORTUNE TELLER HE TELLS THE RIGHT DAY OF MARRIAGE AND SAYS WHETHER THE FATES OF THE TWO PARTIES WILL COMBINE WELL GIVES CLUES TO THE CAUSES OF SUDDEN ILLNESS AND INFORMATION AS TO WHAT HAS BECOME OF LOST ARTICLES
7478-98645-0009 THEY SENT TO KNOW IF THE FATES WERE PROPITIOUS TO THE CHANGE FOR ALL THE FAMILY THE DAY AND YEAR OF BIRTH OF EACH WAS TOLD
7478-98645-0010 AND SO THE YOUNG MAN STAYED AS A VISITOR AT HIS FATHER'S HOUSE FOR THE REMAINING MONTHS OF THE YEAR AFTER WHICH HE BECAME ONCE MORE A MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD THUS THE INCONVENIENCE AND THE EVIL WERE BOTH AVOIDED
7478-98645-0011 HER SISTER IN LAW FELL ILL AND BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED HER STRENGTH THE CHILDREN ONE AFTER ANOTHER CAME DOWN WITH VARIOUS DISEASES WHICH THOUGH IN NO CASE FATAL KEPT THE FAMILY IN A STATE OF ANXIETY FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
7478-98645-0012 THE OLD LADY WAS QUITE SURE THAT THERE WAS SOME WITCHCRAFT OR ART MAGIC AT WORK AMONG HER DEAR ONES AND AFTER CONSULTING THE SERVANTS FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE COULD EXPECT NO SYMPATHY IN HER PLANS FROM EITHER HER BROTHER OR HIS WIFE SHE BETOOK HERSELF TO A FORTUNE TELLER TO DISCOVER THROUGH HIS MEANS
7478-98645-0013 THE CAUSES OF THE ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY THE FORTUNE TELLER REVEALED TO HER THE FACT THAT TWO OCCULT FORCES WERE AT WORK BRINGING EVIL UPON THE HOUSE
7478-98645-0014 THE OTHER WAS THE SPIRIT OF A HORSE THAT HAD ONCE BELONGED IN THE FAMILY AND THAT AFTER DEATH REVENGED ITSELF UPON ITS FORMER MASTERS FOR THE HARD SERVICE WHEREWITH IT HAD BEEN MADE TO SERVE THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH THESE TWO POWERS COULD BE APPEASED
7478-98645-0015 WOULD BE BY FINDING THE WELL AND REMOVING THE OBSTRUCTIONS THAT CHOKED IT AND BY ERECTING AN IMAGE OF THE HORSE AND OFFERING TO IT CAKES AND OTHER MEAT OFFERINGS THE FORTUNE TELLER HINTED MOREOVER
7478-98645-0016 AT THIS INFORMATION GO INKYO SAMA WAS MUCH PERTURBED FOR FURTHER AID FOR HER AFFLICTED FAMILY SEEMED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF MONEY AND OF THAT COMMODITY SHE HAD VERY LITTLE BEING MAINLY DEPENDENT UPON HER BROTHER FOR SUPPORT
7478-98645-0017 SHE RETURNED TO HER HOME AND CONSULTED THE SERVANTS UPON THE MATTER BUT THOUGH THEY QUITE AGREED WITH HER THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE THEY HAD LITTLE CAPITAL TO INVEST IN THE ENTERPRISES SUGGESTED BY THE FORTUNE TELLER AT LAST THE OLD LADY WENT TO HER BROTHER
7478-98645-0018 BUT HE ONLY LAUGHED AT HER WELL MEANT ATTEMPTS TO HELP HIS FAMILY AND REFUSED TO GIVE HER MONEY FOR SUCH A PURPOSE SHE RETIRED DISCOURAGED BUT URGED BY THE SERVANTS SHE DECIDED TO MAKE A LAST APPEAL
7478-98645-0019 THIS TIME TO HER SISTER IN LAW WHO MUST SURELY BE MOVED BY THE EVIL THAT WAS THREATENING HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN TAKING SOME OF THE HEAD SERVANTS WITH HER SHE WENT TO HER SISTER AND PRESENTED THE CASE
7478-98645-0020 THIS WAS HER LAST RESORT AND SHE CLUNG TO HER FORLORN HOPE LONGER THAN MANY WOULD HAVE DONE THE SERVANTS ADDING THEIR ARGUMENTS TO HER IMPASSIONED APPEALS ONLY TO FIND OUT AFTER ALL THAT THE STEADFAST SISTER COULD NOT BE MOVED AND THAT SHE WOULD NOT PROPITIATE THE HORSE'S SPIRIT
7478-98645-0021 OR ALLOW MONEY TO BE USED FOR SUCH A PURPOSE SHE GAVE IT UP THEN AND SAT DOWN TO AWAIT THE FATE OF HER DOOMED HOUSE DOUBTLESS WONDERING MUCH AND SIGHING OFTEN OVER THE FOOLISH SKEPTICISM OF HER NEAR RELATIVES AND WISHING THAT THE RATIONALISTIC TENDENCIES OF THE TIME
7478-98645-0022 BESIDE THESE CALLINGS THERE ARE OTHER EMPLOYMENTS WHICH ARE NOT REGARDED AS WHOLLY RESPECTABLE BY EITHER JAPANESE OR FOREIGNERS
7478-98645-0023 OR ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE DANCING GIRLS ARE TRAINED AND LET OUT BY THE DAY OR EVENING TO TEA HOUSES OR PRIVATE PARTIES ARE USUALLY MANAGED BY WOMEN AT THESE ESTABLISHMENTS LITTLE GIRLS ARE TAKEN SOMETIMES BY CONTRACT WITH THEIR PARENTS SOMETIMES ADOPTED BY THE PROPRIETORS OF THE HOUSE
7478-98645-0024 AND FROM VERY EARLY YOUTH ARE TRAINED NOT ONLY IN THE ART OF DANCING BUT ARE TAUGHT SINGING AND SAMISEN PLAYING ALL THE ETIQUETTE OF SERVING AND ENTERTAINING GUESTS AND WHATEVER ELSE GOES TO MAKE A GIRL CHARMING TO THE OPPOSITE SEX
7478-98645-0025 WHEN THOROUGHLY TAUGHT THEY FORM A VALUABLE INVESTMENT AND WELL REPAY THE LABOR SPENT UPON THEM FOR A POPULAR GEISHA COMMANDS A GOOD PRICE EVERYWHERE AND HAS HER TIME OVERCROWDED WITH ENGAGEMENTS
7478-98645-0026 A JAPANESE ENTERTAINMENT IS HARDLY REGARDED AS COMPLETE WITHOUT GEISHAS IN ATTENDANCE AND THEIR DANCING MUSIC AND GRACEFUL SERVICE AT SUPPER FORM A CHARMING ADDITION TO AN EVENING OF ENJOYMENT AT A TEA HOUSE
7478-98645-0027 ARE HIRED TO MARCH IN QUAINT UNIFORMS IN THE PROCESSION OR BORNE ALOFT ON GREAT DASHI DANCE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ADMIRING CROWDS THE JAPANESE DANCES ARE CHARMINGLY GRACEFUL AND MODEST
7478-98645-0028 THE SWAYING OF THE BODY AND LIMBS THE ARTISTIC MANAGEMENT OF THE FLOWING DRAPERIES THE VARIETY OF THEMES AND COSTUMES OF THE DIFFERENT DANCES ALL GO TO MAKE AN ENTERTAINMENT BY GEISHAS ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST OF JAPANESE ENJOYMENTS SOMETIMES IN SCARLET AND YELLOW ROBES
7478-98645-0029 THE DAINTY MAIDENS IMITATE WITH THEIR SUPPLE BODIES THE DANCE OF THE MAPLE LEAVES AS THEY ARE DRIVEN HITHER AND THITHER IN THE AUTUMN WIND SOMETIMES WITH TUCKED UP KIMONOS AND JAUNTY RED PETTICOATS THEY PLAY THE PART OF LITTLE COUNTRY GIRLS CARRYING THEIR EGGS TO MARKET IN THE NEIGHBORING VILLAGE
7478-98645-0030 AGAIN CLAD IN ARMOR THEY SIMULATE THE WARLIKE GESTURES AND MARTIAL STAMP OF SOME OF THE OLD TIME HEROES OR WITH WHITENED FACES AND HOARY LOCKS THEY PERFORM WITH RAKE AND BROOM THE DANCE OF THE GOOD OLD MAN AND OLD WOMAN WHO PLAY SO PROMINENT A PART IN JAPANESE PICTURES AND THEN
7478-98645-0031 WHEN THE DANCE IS OVER AND ALL ARE BEWITCHED WITH THEIR GRACE AND BEAUTY
7478-98645-0032 LAUGHING AND JESTING THE WHILE UNTIL THERE IS LITTLE WONDER IF THE YOUNG MEN AT THE ENTERTAINMENT DRINK MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR THEM AND LEAVE THE TEA HOUSE AT LAST THOROUGHLY TIPSY
7478-98645-0033 THE GEISHAS UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH FAIR ARE FRAIL IN THEIR SYSTEM OF EDUCATION MANNERS STAND HIGHER THAN MORALS AND MANY A GEISHA GLADLY LEAVES THE DANCING IN THE TEA HOUSES TO BECOME THE CONCUBINE OF SOME WEALTHY JAPANESE OR FOREIGNER THINKING NONE THE WORSE OF HERSELF FOR SUCH A BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT
7478-98645-0034 THE GEISHA IS NOT NECESSARILY BAD BUT THERE IS IN HER LIFE MUCH TEMPTATION TO EVIL AND LITTLE STIMULUS TO DO RIGHT SO THAT WHERE ONE LIVES BLAMELESS MANY GO WRONG AND DROP BELOW THE MARGIN OF RESPECTABILITY ALTOGETHER
7478-98645-0035 YET SO FASCINATING BRIGHT AND LIVELY ARE THESE GEISHAS THAT MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY MEN OF GOOD POSITION AS WIVES AND ARE NOW THE HEADS OF THE MOST RESPECTABLE HOMES WITHOUT TRUE EDUCATION OR MORALS BUT TRAINED THOROUGHLY IN ALL THE ARTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT PLEASE
7478-98645-0036 WITTY QUICK AT REPARTEE PRETTY AND ALWAYS WELL DRESSED THE GEISHA HAS PROVED A FORMIDABLE RIVAL FOR THE DEMURE QUIET MAIDEN OF GOOD FAMILY WHO CAN ONLY GIVE HER HUSBAND AN UNSULLIED NAME SILENT OBEDIENCE AND FAITHFUL SERVICE ALL HER LIFE
7478-98645-0037 THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESENT AGE AS SHOWN IN THE CHAPTER ON MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE
7478-98645-0038 OR TO CHANGE THE OLD SYSTEM OF EDUCATION FOR GIRLS A LIBERAL EDUCATION AND MORE FREEDOM IN EARLY LIFE FOR WOMEN HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AND IS NOW BEING TRIED BUT THE PROBLEM OF THE GEISHA AND HER FASCINATION IS A DEEP ONE IN JAPAN
7478-98645-0039 BELOW THE GEISHA IN RESPECTABILITY STANDS THE J O R O OR LICENSED PROSTITUTE EVERY CITY IN JAPAN HAS ITS DISREPUTABLE QUARTER WHERE THE VARIOUS J O R O YA OR LICENSED HOUSES OF PROSTITUTION ARE SITUATED
7478-98645-0040 DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO MAKE THEIR HOUSES GROUNDS AND EMPLOYEES ATTRACTIVE AND TO THE UNSUSPECTING FOREIGNER THIS PORTION OF THE CITY SEEMS OFTEN THE PLEASANTEST AND MOST RESPECTABLE A J O R O NEED NEVER BE TAKEN FOR A RESPECTABLE WOMAN FOR HER DRESS IS DISTINCTIVE
7478-98645-0041 AND A STAY OF A SHORT TIME IN JAPAN IS LONG ENOUGH TO TEACH EVEN THE MOST OBTUSE THAT THE OBI OR SASH TIED IN FRONT INSTEAD OF BEHIND IS ONE OF THE BADGES OF SHAME BUT THOUGH THE OCCUPATION OF THE J O R O IS ALTOGETHER DISREPUTABLE
7478-98645-0042 THOUGH THE PROSTITUTE QUARTER IS THE SPOT TO WHICH THE POLICE TURN FOR INFORMATION IN REGARD TO CRIMINALS AND LAW BREAKERS A SORT OF A TRAP INTO WHICH SOONER OR LATER THE OFFENDER AGAINST THE LAW IS SURE TO FALL JAPANESE PUBLIC OPINION THOUGH RECOGNIZING THE EVIL AS A GREAT ONE
7478-98645-0043 ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT SINS OF THIS CHARACTER ARE REGARDED MUCH MORE LENIENTLY IN JAPAN THAN IN ENGLAND OR AMERICA THE REASON LIES VERY LARGELY IN THE FACT THAT THESE WOMEN ARE SELDOM FREE AGENTS MANY OF THEM ARE VIRTUALLY SLAVES
7478-98645-0044 SOLD IN CHILDHOOD TO THE KEEPERS OF THE HOUSES IN WHICH THEY WORK AND TRAINED AMID THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE J O R O YA FOR THE LIFE WHICH IS THE ONLY LIFE THEY HAVE EVER KNOWN A FEW MAY HAVE SACRIFICED THEMSELVES FREELY BUT RELUCTANTLY FOR THOSE WHOM THEY LOVE
7478-98645-0045 AND BY THEIR REVOLTING SLAVERY MAY BE EARNING THE MEANS TO KEEP THEIR DEAR ONES FROM STARVATION OR DISGRACE
7478-98645-0046 A LOVER WHO IS WILLING TO RAISE HER AGAIN TO A LIFE OF RESPECTABILITY AND MAKE HER A HAPPY WIFE AND THE MOTHER OF CHILDREN
7478-98645-0047 BUT THE NO DANCE WAS THE ONLY DRAMATIC AMUSEMENT OF THE NOBILITY THIS NO IS AN ANCIENT JAPANESE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE MORE PERHAPS LIKE THE GREEK DRAMA THAN ANYTHING IN OUR MODERN LIFE ALL THE MOVEMENTS OF THE ACTORS ARE MEASURED AND CONVENTIONALIZED
7478-98645-0048 THE REGULAR THEATRE PRESERVES IN MANY WAYS THE LIFE AND COSTUMES OF OLD JAPAN AND THE DETAILS OF DRESS AND SCENERY ARE MOST CAREFULLY STUDIED THE ACTORS ARE USUALLY MEN
7478-98645-0049 IN NO CASE ARE THE ROLES TAKEN BY BOTH SEXES UPON ONE STAGE AS THE PERFORMANCES LAST ALL DAY FROM TEN OR ELEVEN IN THE FORENOON UNTIL EIGHT OR NINE IN THE EVENING GOING TO THE THEATRE MEANS MUCH MORE THAN A FEW HOURS OF ENTERTAINMENT AFTER THE DAY'S WORK IS OVER
7478-98645-0050 A LUNCH AND DINNER WITH INNUMERABLE LIGHT EDIBLES BETWEEN GO TO MAKE UP THE USUAL BILL OF FARE FOR A DAY AT THE PLAY AND TEA HOUSES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE THEATRE PROVIDE THE NECESSARY MEALS
7478-98645-0051 A ROOM TO TAKE THEM IN A RESTING PLACE BETWEEN THE ACTS AND WHATEVER TEA CAKES AND OTHER REFRESHMENTS MAY BE ORDERED THESE LATTER EATABLES ARE SERVED BY THE ATTENDANTS OF THE TEA HOUSE IN THE THEATRE BOXES WHILE THE PLAY IS IN PROGRESS
7478-98645-0052 SIMILAR TO THE THEATRE IN MANY WAYS ARE THE PUBLIC HALLS WHERE PROFESSIONAL STORY TELLERS THE HANASHIKA NIGHT AFTER NIGHT RELATE LONG STORIES TO CROWDED AUDIENCES AS POWERFULLY AND VIVIDLY AS THE BEST TRAINED ELOCUTIONIST
7478-98645-0053 EACH GESTURE AND EACH MODULATION OF THE VOICE IS STUDIED AS CAREFULLY AS ARE THOSE OF THE ACTORS MANY CHARMING TALES ARE TOLD OF OLD JAPAN AND EVEN WESTERN STORIES HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY TO THESE ASSEMBLIES
7478-98645-0054 A LONG STORY IS OFTEN CONTINUED FROM NIGHT TO NIGHT UNTIL FINISHED UNFORTUNATELY THE CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO PATRONIZE THESE PLACES IS LOW
7478-98645-0055 TO AMUSE A LARGE COMPANY BY THEIR ELOQUENCE OR MIMICRY THIS IS A VERY FAVORITE ENTERTAINMENT AND THE HANASHIKA HAS SO PERFECTED THE ART OF IMITATION THAT HE CAN CHANGE IN A MOMENT FROM THE TONES OF A CHILD TO THOSE OF AN OLD WOMAN
7478-98645-0056 SOLEMN AND SAD SUBJECTS ARE TOUCHED UPON AS WELL AS MERRY AND BRIGHT THINGS AND HE NEVER FAILS TO MAKE HIS AUDIENCE WEEP OR LAUGH ACCORDING TO HIS THEME AND WELL MERITS THE APPLAUSE HE ALWAYS RECEIVES AT THE END
7478-98645-0057 THE HANAMI OR PICNIC TO FAMOUS PLACES TO VIEW CERTAIN FLOWERS AS THEY BLOOM IN THEIR SEASON THOUGH NOT BELONGING STRICTLY TO CITY LIFE FORMS ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE PLEASURES OF CITY PEOPLE THE RIVER SUMIDA ON WHICH T O KY O IS SITUATED
7478-98645-0058 WITH THEIR LARGE DOUBLE PINK BLOSSOMS AND WHEN IN APRIL AND MAY THESE FLOWERS ARE IN THEIR PERFECTION GREAT CROWDS OF SIGHTSEERS FLOCK TO MUK O JIMA TO ENJOY THE BLOSSOMS UNDER THE TREES
7478-98645-0059 THE RIVER IS CROWDED WITH PICNIC PARTIES IN BOATS EVERY TEA HOUSE ALONG THE BANKS IS FULL OF GUESTS AND THE LITTLE STALLS AND RESTING PLACES ON THE WAY FIND A QUICK SALE FOR FRUIT CONFECTIONERY AND LIGHT LUNCHES SAKE IS OFTEN TOO FREELY IMBIBED BY THE MERRYMAKERS
7478-98645-0060 WHOSE FLUSHED FACES SHOW WHEN RETURNING HOMEWARD HOW THEIR DAY WAS SPENT THERE IS MUCH QUIET ENJOYMENT TOO OF THE LOVELY BLOSSOMS THE BROAD CALM RIVER AND THE GAYLY DRESSED CROWDS
7478-98645-0061 KAMEIDO FOR THE PLUM AND WISTARIA OJI FOR ITS FAMOUS MAPLE TREES AND MANY OTHERS EACH NOTED FOR SOME SPECIAL BEAUTY DANGO ZAKA HAS ITS OWN PECULIAR ATTRACTION THE FAMOUS CHRYSANTHEMUM DOLLS
7478-98645-0062 THESE INGENIOUS FIGURES ARE ARRANGED SO AS TO FORM TABLEAUX SCENES FROM HISTORY OR FICTION WELL KNOWN TO ALL THE PEOPLE THEY ARE OF LIFE SIZE AND THE FACES HANDS AND FEET ARE MADE OF SOME COMPOSITION AND CLOSELY RESEMBLE LIFE IN EVERY DETAIL
7478-98645-0063 IS THAT THE SCENERY WHETHER IT BE THE REPRESENTATION OF A WATERFALL ROCKS OR BUSHES
7478-98645-0064 SO CLOSELY ARE THE LEAVES AND FLOWERS BOUND TOGETHER TO MAKE THE FLAT SURFACE OF DIFFERENT OBJECTS BUT ALIVE AND GROWING ON THE PLANTS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHERE THE ROOTS AND STEMS ARE HIDDEN FOR NOTHING IS VISIBLE BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE WHITE SPRAY AND GREENISH SHADOWS OF A WATERFALL
7478-98645-0065 OR THE PARTI COLORED FIGURES IN A YOUNG GIRL'S DRESS BUT SHOULD IT BE THE VISITOR'S GOOD FORTUNE TO WATCH THE REPAIRING OF ONE OF THESE LIFELIKE IMAGES HE WILL FIND THAT THE ENTIRE BODY IS A FRAME WOVEN OF SPLIT BAMBOO WITHIN WHICH THE PLANTS ARE PLACED THEIR ROOTS PACKED IN DAMP EARTH AND BOUND ABOUT WITH STRAW
7478-98645-0066 WHILE THEIR LEAVES AND FLOWERS ARE PULLED THROUGH THE BASKET FRAME AND WOVEN INTO WHATSOEVER PATTERN THE ARTISTIC EYE AND SKILLFUL FINGERS OF THE GARDENER MAY SELECT A ROOF OF MATTING SHIELDS EACH GROUP FROM THE SUN BY DAY AND A SLIGHT SPRINKLING EVERY NIGHT
7478-98645-0067 SERVES TO KEEP THE PLANTS FRESH FOR NEARLY A MONTH AND THE FLOWERS CONTINUE THEIR BLOOMING DURING THAT TIME AS CALMLY AS IF IN PERFECTLY NATURAL POSITIONS EACH OF THE GARDENERS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS HIS OWN LITTLE SHOW CONTAINING SEVERAL TABLEAUX
7478-98645-0068 THE ENTRANCE TO WHICH IS GUARDED BY AN OFFICIOUS GATE KEEPER WHO SHOUTS OUT THE MERITS OF HIS PARTICULAR GROUPS OF FIGURES AND FORCES HIS SHOW BILLS UPON THE PASSER BY IN THE HOPE OF SECURING THE TWO SEN ADMISSION FEE WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR EACH EXHIBIT
